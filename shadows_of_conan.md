# Shadows of Conan
A mash-up of Shadows of Brimstone and Conan by Monolith. Sticks mostly to the design of Conan using Shadows of Brimstone theme, content, models, etc. Few mechanical design changes would be necessary to make this work well, even though I have ideas for a few of them.

## Darkness Track
The Conan turn track would be replaced by the Darkness track from SoB. Instead of rolling to hold back the darkness, this would be a push/pull mechanic similar to a morale system in other war games. It would be mainly used as a balancing mechanic providing more "darkness" to the Overlord as the Heroes do better, or more "progress" to the Heroes as the Overlord does better. How the new Darkness/Progress resources get used as a resources ties into Encounter cards...

## Encounter Cards
Explore tokens are placed faced down in areas on the board and are revealed when entered by a Hero. These tokens can be one of the following:
  - Attack! (Overlord gets to place some reinforcements.)
  - Ambush! (Overlord gets to place enemies in the space.)
  - Clue (Used by some scenarios)
  - Encounter (Draw and resolve an Encounter card).

Encounter cards would be read aloud and give an opportunity for the Overlord to "spend darkness" from the track to make skill tests more difficult and/or consequences worse. Hero's could then "spend progress" as opposed to gems for re-rolls on the skill tests.


## Darkness Cards
A random Darkness card would be drawn whenever the Overlord plays the Event tile in the River.

## Remove Player Elimination
Need to remove player elimination. Maybe take the "pool of heroes" approach from The Others?

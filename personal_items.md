# Shadows of Brimstone - Personal Items Reference
This is a reference of Personal Item cards available to Heroes during character creation. When creating a new character, players get to draw a random Personal Item card that they keep for the duration of the campaign. This reference is a list of each Personal Item card and their gameplay rules/effects.  

**Themed Personal Item Decks**  
Personal Item cards have been created and themed for different settings over the history of Shadows of Brimstone. This reference separates the Personal Item cards into their different themed decks so that a random card from the appropriate deck can be drawn, depending on the native setting that the Hero Class comes from. The different themed Personal Item decks are:

- Brimstone Personal Items: For Hero Classes native to the Old West setting of Brimstone. 
- Forbidden Fortress Personal Items: For Hero Classes native to the feudal japanese setting of the Forbidden Fortress.
- Jargono Personal Items: For Hero Classes native to the Swamps of Jargono OtherWorld setting.

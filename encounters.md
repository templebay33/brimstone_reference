This is a reference of Encounter Cards for Shadows of Brimstone. 

## Forbidden Fortress Encounters

### Box of Death
Keywords: Fortress, Encounter, Active, Death, Plague

Flavor: A large wooden chest sits at the far end of this room, ornately carved with skulls and bones. As you approach, hissing voices whisper in your mind, speaking in a dark and ancient tongue.

Skill Test: Single Hero, Lore 6+

Effects: If successful, gain 30 XP and you may draw a Loot card, found in the box. An offering from the gods of death.
If failed, place D3 Corpse Tokens in empty spaces adjacent to the Hero that failed the test and then each Hero must individually draw a Vile Plague card and suffer the effects of that card (each Vile Plague only effects the Hero that drew it).

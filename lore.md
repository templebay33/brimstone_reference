## Dark Stone
Dark Stone is perhaps the most important narrative concept to understand the many worlds of Shadows of Brimstone. Dark Stone is a mysterious black rock mineral, appearing purple when held in the light. The origins of Dark Stone is not known. Sometimes, a vein of Dark Stone is discovered deep within the ground when prospectors are mining for other valuable ores such as copper and gold. Other times, Dark Stone comes crashing into the atmosphere as a meteorite, breaking up in the sky and scattering across the land. 

Dark Stone is the most valuable substance in Shadows of Brimstone. It can be used as an energy source to power industry, rail cars, great machines, and even starships. It can be shaped and molded into material such as arrowheads, blade tips, armored plating, or simply worn as jewelry. Blacksmiths and other craftesmen have taken to modifying weapons, trinkets, and other equipment with Dark Stone for enhanced effects. Soothsayers, witches, shamans, and monks use the black rock in their rituals, spells, tonics and cure-alls. The versatility of Dark Stone seems to be virtually unlimited.

The value of Dark Stone can be seen in how common it is for various cultures and civilizations across time and space to use Dark Stone as a type of currency when bartering and trading. But Dark Stone is every bit as dangerous as it is valuable. 

While normal people can't sense it, Dark Stone emits a kind of radiation colloqually referred to as "corruption". Nobody knows why, but prolonged exposure to the substance in high enough densities often cause organic life to mutate. These mutations vary greatly from arms and legs turning into tentacles, forked tongues, grown over eyes, fangs, and hardened skin. Unique and strange mutations are discovered all the time. Dark Stone seems to be capable of mutating just about any life form, not just humans. It has been known to "corrupt" all manner of flora and fauna. 

Dark Stone also becomes unstable when stored in dense concentrations. This has been known to cause occasional explosions and sometimes cause people to suffer strange and terrifying hallucinations. Some are even driven to complete madness by the corrupting influence of Dark Stone. This has always made Dark Stone tricky to store and transpored for those wanted to grow rich off its great bounty, but greed often wins over and the danger is ignored.

Perhaps the most interesting effect of Dark Stone in dense concentrations is to occasionally tear a hole in the very fabric of reality, creating a gateway between worlds across time, space, and even dimensions. These tears are sometimes fleeting, such that a few strange and terrifying creatures make it through the crack in reality before it closes, able to wreak havoc on those unprepared on the other side. Other times, a more stable Gate is formed, allowing travel to and from two distinct worlds for anyone brave enough to cross over. But one never knows how long each Gate will remain stable.

As a narrative element, Dark Stone is central to many stories in Shadows of Brimstone. Greed for Dark Stone creates conflict among those who want it. The destruction caused by Dark Stone calls to would be Heroes and Adventurers willing to help. The corrupting influence of Dark Stone is at the core of many of the dangerous foes encountered by adventurers. But Dark Stone is also a reward, able to be sold, used to craft powerful weapons and gear, and opens Gates to new worlds and frontiers to explore.

## Gates
In the context of Shadows of Brimstone, Gates are portals that bridge two worlds. Not much is known about how to create or control them, or how long they remain stable. It is widely known that Gates seem to be created by concentrations of Dark Stone. Gates don't always form where Dark Stone is found, but when they do, there is always Dark Stone nearby. That there is a connection between the two phenomena is clear.

It's hard to tell how long a Gate will remain stable. It could be hours, days, or weeks. But they do seem to eventually close again.

There is no telling where the other end of a Gate will take you until you are close enough to peer through to the other side. Sometimes, people try and create gates themselves by concentrating Dark Stone and risking explosions or awful mutations. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, but so far, nobody has found a way to force a Gate to open to a specific world, time, or dimension.

The more Gates appear, the bigger reality seems to get. While still quite a spectacle, it's not impossible to come across an adventurous Japanese samurai from the feudal era of Japan's history wandering back alleys of an 1850's American frontier town in the Wild West. Sometimes, even aliens from other worlds can be found around the poker table of a frontier western saloon. It seems like a Gate could lead almost anywhere or any time, even to other dimensions like Hell itself!

Gates are another central narrative element and often important features of quests, missions, and exciting encounters. They provide endless variety and opportunity to continue expanding the setting of Shadows of Brimstone into completely new places to keep the stories and adventures feeling fresh.

## Characters

## Factions and Creatures
While most factions and creatures are usually treated as dangerous Enemies in the game, sometimes players are able to play as characters belonging to a faction they are normally enemies with, such as Trederrans. Because of this, "Factions and Creatures" is used as the title for this section instead of "Enemies". There is always the possibility for narrative situations in which these characters take roles such as NPC's and companions instead of enemies during an adventure.

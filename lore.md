## Dark Stone
Dark Stone is perhaps the most important narrative concept to understand the many worlds of Shadows of Brimstone. Dark Stone is a mysterious black rock mineral, appearing purple when held in the light. The origins of Dark Stone is not known. Sometimes, a vein of Dark Stone is discovered deep within the ground when prospectors are mining for other valuable ores such as copper and gold. Other times, Dark Stone comes crashing into the atmosphere as a meteorite, breaking up in the sky and scattering across the land.  

Dark Stone is the most valuable substance in Shadows of Brimstone. It can be used as an energy source to power industry, rail cars, great machines, and even starships. It can be shaped and molded into material such as arrowheads, blade tips, armored plating, or simply worn as jewelry. Blacksmiths and other craftesmen have taken to modifying weapons, trinkets, and other equipment with Dark Stone for enhanced effects. Soothsayers, witches, shamans, and monks use the black rock in their rituals, spells, tonics and cure-alls. The versatility of Dark Stone seems to be virtually unlimited.  

The value of Dark Stone can be seen in how common it is for various cultures and civilizations across time and space to use Dark Stone as a type of currency when bartering and trading. But Dark Stone is every bit as dangerous as it is valuable.  

While normal people can't sense it, Dark Stone emits a kind of radiation colloqually referred to as "corruption". Nobody knows why, but prolonged exposure to the substance in high enough densities often cause organic life to mutate. These mutations vary greatly from arms and legs turning into tentacles, forked tongues, grown over eyes, fangs, and hardened skin. Unique and strange mutations are discovered all the time. Dark Stone seems to be capable of mutating just about any life form, not just humans. It has been known to "corrupt" all manner of flora and fauna.  

Dark Stone also becomes unstable when stored in dense concentrations. This has been known to cause occasional explosions and sometimes cause people to suffer strange and terrifying hallucinations. Some are even driven to complete madness by the corrupting influence of Dark Stone. This has always made Dark Stone tricky to store and transpored for those wanted to grow rich off its great bounty, but greed often wins over and the danger is ignored.  

Perhaps the most interesting effect of Dark Stone in dense concentrations is to occasionally tear a hole in the very fabric of reality, creating a gateway between worlds across time, space, and even dimensions. These tears are sometimes fleeting, such that a few strange and terrifying creatures make it through the crack in reality before it closes, able to wreak havoc on those unprepared on the other side. Other times, a more stable Gate is formed, allowing travel to and from two distinct worlds for anyone brave enough to cross over. But one never knows how long each Gate will remain stable.  

As a narrative element, Dark Stone is central to many stories in Shadows of Brimstone. Greed for Dark Stone creates conflict among those who want it. The destruction caused by Dark Stone calls to would be Heroes and Adventurers willing to help. The corrupting influence of Dark Stone is at the core of many of the dangerous foes encountered by adventurers. But Dark Stone is also a reward, able to be sold, used to craft powerful weapons and gear, and opens Gates to new worlds and frontiers to explore.  

## Gates
In the context of Shadows of Brimstone, Gates are portals that bridge two worlds. Not much is known about how to create or control them, or how long they remain stable. It is widely known that Gates seem to be created by concentrations of Dark Stone. Gates don't always form where Dark Stone is found, but when they do, there is always Dark Stone nearby. That there is a connection between the two phenomena is clear.  

It's hard to tell how long a Gate will remain stable. It could be hours, days, or weeks. But they do seem to eventually close again.  

There is no telling where the other end of a Gate will take you until you are close enough to peer through to the other side. Sometimes, people try and create gates themselves by concentrating Dark Stone and risking explosions or awful mutations. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, but so far, nobody has found a way to force a Gate to open to a specific world, time, or dimension.  

The more Gates appear, the bigger reality seems to get. While still quite a spectacle, it's not impossible to come across an adventurous Japanese samurai from the feudal era of Japan's history wandering back alleys of an 1850's American frontier town in the Wild West. Sometimes, even aliens from other worlds can be found around the poker table of a frontier western saloon. It seems like a Gate could lead almost anywhere or any time, even to other dimensions like Hell itself!  

Gates are another central narrative element and often important features of quests, missions, and exciting encounters. They provide endless variety and opportunity to continue expanding the setting of Shadows of Brimstone into completely new places to keep the stories and adventures feeling fresh.  

## Worlds
Since Dark Stone causes tears in the fabric of reality and sometimes bridges two realites together through a gate, there are limitless possibilities when it comes to to the variety of settings that adventurers can explore when stepping through a gate to another world.  

Within the game rules, each core set of the game (a "core set" provides all of the required minimum rules and components to play Shadows of Brimstone in a single box which can then be mixed with the content sold in other boxes such as expansions and other core sets.) has a default world setting which is native to the Heroes that come as part of the core set. For example, the Forbidden Fortress core set contains Heroes native to the high fantasy Feudal Japan setting and world. The world that is native to the Heroes can be thought of as the "home" or "main" world for the game, even though the rule books don't have a specific word for that in game terms.  

All other worlds that are **not** native to the Heroes are considered to be an "OtherWorld". Each core set comes with a single OtherWorld for the starting Heroes to explore. Each OtherWorld is a unique setting that might take place in a different time period, on a different planet, or even a different dimension or reality! In addition, each OtherWorld setting has a variety of Map Tiles, Artifacts, Encounters, and Enemies that are designed to be "native" to the OtherWorld, making each OtherWorld setting feel unique from the others during an adventure.  

Most OtherWorld settings feature some kind of Environment rule which is always in effect while the Heroes are located in the OtherWorld. These could be anything from unique weather game effects to anything else that makes good thematic use of the setting.  

Additional OtherWorlds can be purchased as part of Deluxe Expansions to increase the variety of OtherWorld settings that Heroes can explore on their adventure.  

Visiting an OtherWorld can happen either randomly or by design. During an adventure in the "main" world native to the Heroes, there is a random possiblity in most missions for a gate to an OtherWorld to spawn as the Heroes explore the map tiles. When a Gate is spawned, a deck of Environment cards matching each OtherWorld is shuffled and drawn randomly to see where the Gate leads. Players are of course free to pick a specific world that they want to visit instead, and some missions may specify that all Gates lead to a specific OtherWorld as part of their design.  

The rest this section provides narrative descriptions of each world setting, including all the "native" worlds. It is perfectly viable for fans to create new OtherWorld locations to visit, but this will typically require a lot of work due to the need for a lot of content that needs to be created for adding a new world, such as custom map tiles and cards, encounters, artifacts, a depth event chart unique to the world, and environment rule for the world, and several enemies to encounter which are native to the world. Of course, generative AI may be able to greatly assist fans in reducing the amount of effort needed to create all of the necessary content for adding new worlds to the game!

### Sunken City of Pharrox
Once a powerful kingdom of the ancient world, ruled by a dynasty of ruthless vampires, the island city of Pharrox Atlantea was destroyed, sinking to the cold depths of the sea. For millennia it was left undisturbed and forgotten to history; its ancient inhabitants dormant in a twilight slumber. Now, its shimmering gateways have been activated once again by those seeking its lost knowledge and treasures. But all they will find... are the Terrors of the Deep!  

## Characters

## Hero Classes
These Hero Class descriptions help flesh out a better narrative picture of their roles within the setting of Shadows of Brimstone.  
### Valkyrie Shield Maiden
Riding down from the sky on a winged steed, the death dealing Valkyrie is a warrior maiden in the service of Odin himself, the god of war! Though their numbers are few next to the hordes of beasts and demons that have overrun the land now tainted by the void energies of the Dark Stone, the Valkyries have come to help defend the lands of mortal men from the encroaching Darkness.  

## Team Heroes
Team Heroes are additional Hero Classes that can be found in various Adventure Set and Expansion products. They function just like normal Hero classes, but are narratively designed to work together as a team. Being thematically part of a team, they likely have a shared overlapping history for role playing purposes.  

### Trederran Strike Team
The Trederran Strike Team is an elite fighting squad of alien Special Forces soldiers, deployed on dangerous missions by the High Command of their Trederran Nation.  

This Expansion includes the new Trederran Team Heroes, with 4 unique types of Trederrans to play as - the Sergeant, leading the team with grim determination, the Legionnaire, an elite soldier pulled from the front lines, the Specialist, a master in using the various Weapons of War, and the Engineer, a demolitions and tech expert. This allows players to take on the role of a team of alien Anti-Heroes for the first time.  

The Trederran Strike Team Expansion includes the Trederran Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – the Sergeant, Legionnaire, Engineer, and Specialist.  

**Sergeant** – A veteran of many campaigns, the Sergeant is a grizzled soldier who charges into the fray, leading his men on deadly missions. Armed with a Sergeant’s Sabre and Master Forged Trench Pistol, he closes with deadly speed to engage his foes up close and personal, while giving Commands to his unit.  

**Legionnaire** – Pulled from the Trenches to go on special operations as part of the Strike Team, the Legionnaire is the best at what he does. Equipped with the full trench gear, Shatter Grenades, and weaponry of a front lines soldier, he is a crack shot, armed to the teeth!  

**Engineer** – The Engineer is a master of tech and demolitions, brandishing an Arc Light Pistol and using the latest in Trederran technology with an array of Dark Stone powered gadgets. Utilizing stealth over sheer force, the Engineer helps the team to overcome obstacles, locate their objectives, and is the best equipped to set up toxic gas generators and other nefarious devices.   

**Specialist** – Heavily armored and trained in the use of a variety of powerful Weapons of War, the Specialist can select a different Special Weapon at the start of each Adventure, to suit the needs of the mission. Whether wielding a Grenade Launcher, a Dragon Fire Thrower, a Light Machine Gun, or even a brutal Chain-Blade, the Specialist adds extra punch to the Strike Team’s arsenal.   

### Viking Team Heroes
The Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set includes the Viking Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – the Jarl chieftain, Huscarl honor guard, Raider, and Berserker.  

**Jarl** – A Leader of the clan, the Jarl is a brutal and stubborn warrior. Armed with a two-handed War Axe and a heavy coat of Mail Armor, he splits his foes in half with deadly force, boosting his Rage by rolling Critical Hits or shrugging off damage with his chainmail armor.  

**Huscarl** – One of the clan’s distinguished honor guard, the Huscarl carries a hefty Shield and Norse Sword, crafted to cut down the savage Beasts and Demons of the north. She is also an expert with the Viking Bow, used to pick off Enemies at a distance and take quick shots at the beginning of a skirmish, before she charges into the fray.  

**Raider** – The most classic Viking, a Raider is a warrior of few words, most often uttered as a Battle Roar before leaping into combat. Armed with Heavy Furs, a Raider’s Helmet, Shield, and Viking Axe, the Raider hacks Enemies apart, shrugging off hordes of foes as he goes.  

**Berserker** – Whipped into a frenzy of battle, the Berserker is a madman. Swinging two lethal axes, and fighting bare-chested, but for a wolf pelt slung over his shoulders, the Berserker unleashes his Rage in a swirling melee of death and destruction. Though not the most accurate or defensive of fighters, he makes up for it with a dizzying flurry of blows!  

### Conquistadors
The Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set includes the Conquistador Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – El Capitan, the Explorer, Duelist, and Soldier.  

**El Capitan** – Leading the way, El Capitan is guided by his Boundless Ambition. Adorned in finely-crafted armor and a plumed helmet, he stands at the head of the expedition, slicing down any foes that stand in his way with an armored fist and his ruthless Steel Sword.  

**Explorer** – The quintessential Spanish Conquistador, the Explorer wears a classic breast plate and Morion Helmet, and is armed with a sword of finest Spanish steel. He specializes in helping the group to pick their way through the jungles and swamps, seeking out vast treasures and avoiding traps set by the villainous Serpentmen that stalk the Valley.  

**Duelist** – A lightly armored fighter, the Duelist prefers speed and agility over brute strength. She is armed with a set of finely crafted Dueling Blades that slice through the air with deadly accuracy, easily parting her opponents from their limbs. The Duelist’s fighting style is more akin to an artful dance of death.  

**Soldier** – Stalwart and stubborn, the Conquistador Soldier is heavily armored, from head to toe, carrying a powerful Crossbow to skewer his foes. A veteran fighter, trained on the battlefields of Europe for over a decade, the Soldier has joined the Expedition to seek out a fortune of his own.  
### Cursed Eternal
One of the twelve crew of Ponce De Leon that explored the wilds to discover the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternals succeeded in their quest for immortality, but at a grim cost. By drinking the Fountain's water, they were granted eternal life, but live out their days in a constant state of withering away, gaunt and pale. Only by cutting down Enemies with his tainted Ghost Blade, and stealing the life essence from his foes, can the Cursed Eternal hold his deterioration at bay.  

## Enemies & Factions
While most factions and creatures are usually treated as dangerous Enemies in the game, sometimes players are able to play as characters belonging to a faction they are normally enemies with, such as Trederrans. Because of this, "Factions and Creatures" is used as the title for this section instead of "Enemies". There is always the possibility for narrative situations in which these characters take roles such as NPC's and companions instead of enemies during an adventure.  

Each enemy design is often narratively connected and native to one of the world settings in Shadows of Brimstone. Of course, due to Gates creating temporary bridges between two worlds, it is possible to encounter enemies that are not native to the world in which the Heroes find themselves exploring. But in general, encountering non-native enemies should be more rare in order to make each world setting feel more narratively cohesive. There are some enemies, such as the Shikari Nomad's, which are specifically designed as enemies that travel through Gates to worlds that are not native to themselves as part of their narrative design.  

### Enemies - Various
**Bastet Assassins**  
Using the shadows to move quickly, unseen and silent, the Bastet Assassins are nimble warriors of the Goddess Bastet. They strike without warning and fade back into the darkness with a whispering purr.  

The Bastet Assassins have a Supernatural Prowess to fade from shadow to shadow, repositioning themselves to the best advantage against the Heroes. With a Rapid Strike, they slice and stab their target with countless cuts, ducking and weaving their way through a fight.  

**Hell Train Void Conductor**  
Tainted by the corruption of the Darkness, the Void Conductor of the Hell Train rings his ominous bell to shift reality around him, tearing open rifts into the Void and spreading terror through the cursed Train!

The Void Conductor is a Hell Train-themed Mini Boss that can buff other Enemies around him and Shift Reality to his will, opening tears in space to unleash fierce creatures from the Void. His body is twisted and in a constant state of mutation and flux, making him a difficult foe to lock down.  

**Hell Bear**  
Bursting through the snowy trees, the mammoth Hell Bear is a terrifying enemy to behold. Towering over the Heroes, this mutated behemoth is tainted by the Darkness and enraged by the power of the Hellborn! Often preceded by menacing roars that echo through the icy crags and across the frozen wastes, the Hell Bears of the Norse Lands are not subtle in their hunting methods.   

The Rage of the Hell Bear is limitless, as it shreds anything within the reach of its massive jaws and powerful clawed arms. Though they often travel on their own, Hell Bears are also renowned for hunting in packs. While one of these wild creatures can be an unstoppable force, an encounter with a pack of them is rarely recounted, as there are few that live long enough to tell the tale.  

The Hell Bear is an XL Beast that can be found on regular Threats (LOW, MED, and HIGH), though often Heavily Mutated when traveling as a pack. A full-strength pack can be encountered as an EPIC Threat. They also appear in the Targa Plateau OtherWorld in the form of the savage Nomadic Yeti.  

Though their heavily mutated form prevents their Health from getting too high, the Hell Bear's Monstrous Rage allows them to be constantly Healing Damage for every Hit assigned to them! This includes Hits that do no Damage, so your Attacks may end up Healing the creature even if they can't break through its Defense.  

With its Ferocious Attack, the Hell Bear always Re-targets each turn, moving to get next to as many Heroes as possible, then making its full Attack against every adjacent Hero. This combined with its Terrifying Claws that ignore Defense on To Hit rolls of 6+, make Hell Bears dangerous foes to face. In addition, their Claws also give Hell Bear Combat Hits an extra Damage bonus if the Hero rolls a natural 1 on their Defense roll for that Hit, as the Hero has left themselves open to a more savage Attack from the creature.  

One XL Hell Bear is dangerous, but a pack of up to 3 Hell Bears at a time can be downright devastating to a Hero Party. One more reason that the Norse Lands are not to be traveled lightly.  

**Shadow Lurker**  
Shifting through the darkness that spreads across all worlds, the Shadow Lurkers are ancient demons of the Void. They are formless, malign entities that watch from the shadows, hungering to feed on the memories and experiences of their victims, as well as the most wretched of human emotions. Jealousy, lust, wrath; but above all...greed. They are drawn to the history and power of relics, stalking those that collect and carry artifacts from world to world. These creatures take on a monstrous humanoid form to erupt from the Darkness, with quivering cheeks and a hate beyond time as they relentlessly terrorize their prey, lashing out with long, clawed fingers and viciously jagged teeth. Shadow Lurkers are nightmares made manifest.  

**Feathered Serpents**  
On feathered wings, the Serpents of Kotak descend from the heavens to hiss and strike at those who would dare intrude on the temples dedicated to their ancient master.  With long, needle-like fangs, the Feathered Serpents deliver a powerful venom to their foes, piercing armor and flesh alike.  Highly agile, the winged serpents dart from target-to-target, lashing out with their tails and using their venomous bite to strike with deadly accuracy.  But perhaps their most dangerous asset is the protection afforded to them by Kotak himself; a powerful death ward that can mend even the most grievous of wounds with the cosmic magik of the Ancients.  

**Fenris Wolves**  
Howling echoes through the snow-capped forests, and the trees rustle in the shadowed crags of the frozen North. Great beasts stalk the mountain passes, and many a traveler and trader has gone missing in these icy hills. Smashed carts and blood-soaked snow are often all that remains after a pack of ravenous Fenris Wolves strikes their prey.  

Standing nearly 8 feet tall, a Fenris Wolf is a nightmare of myth and legend in the North. With great muscular shoulders and powerful jaws that can snap tree trunks like twigs, the Fenris Wolves hunt in packs, striking from the shadows to feed their supernatural hunger for flesh. Even the gods tremble with fear at the largest and most savage of these creatures. The blood of Fenrir, the greatest of their kind, courses through their veins, while the blood of their foes drips from their fangs.  

**Draugar**  
Another fearsome Enemy found in the frozen wastes of the Norse Lands are the Draugar. Fallen warriors corrupted by the Darkness, the Draugar rise back up from their rocky graves and snow covered battlefields to hunt down and drain the essence of the living! Still carrying their rusty weapons and broken shields, and adorned in tattered armor and rotting clothes, these Undead Vikings are mere husks of their former selves.  

It is said that the Draugar feed on the Darkness within, the evil that corrupts the hearts of mortal men, leaching the vitality and essence from all living things that lie in their path. Plants wilt and shrivel to a rotted brown as they pass by, while even the air around them grows icy cold and carries the stench of eternal despair.  

**Thunderforged Titan**  
Forged with roaring thunder and animated by arcing lightning bound within an armored metal shell, these titanic behemoths are the ultimate warriors of Hel, goddess of death. Bursting through the ancient gates of the Underworld, the towering titans emerge from the cold depths of Niflheim to sow chaos and devastation upon the worlds of men and gods alike! Emblazoned with the fiery runes of Muspelheim by the demon-giant Surtr, the Thunderforged Titans leave a trail of flames and erupting magma in their wake as they march to war, and the end of all things... Ragnarok!  

**Lumia Vampires**  
These dark broods travel by night and feed on the living!  They are an ancient and nomadic band of female Vampires of the old world!  Beautiful and haunting, the Lumia Vampires are deadly hunters - with fangs and claws, and an insatiable thirst for blood! Weaving sinister curses and hexing their prey, only the strongest willed Heroes can stand in the face of these terrifying succubi. Their undead flesh can regrow even the most brutal of wounds, mending before your eyes as they rise back up with a renewed hunger to spread their haunting curse with each Vampiric Bite.  

**Feljeagor Slayers**  
Forged in the underworld from thunder and lightning, the Feljeagors are animated suits of meteoric armor made for one purpose...to bring about the end times, Ragnarok! Crackling with dark energy, these automaton warriors march to war, brandishing their Slayer Axes to smite gods and men alike, while the deafening roar of their Fel Horns echo through the mountains, whipping their legions into a frenzy of rage.  

**Drowned Dead**  
One of the main Enemies that Conquistador Heroes will face in the Valley of the Serpent Kings Brimstone Adventures Set are the ghastly and terrifying Drowned Dead that roam the halls of the Spanish Forts! These shambling horrors were once fellow Conquistadors; explorers that came before and have fallen into darkness. Their Corroded Armor hangs loose on their rotten bodies, dripping water and trailing shreds of seaweed and vines pulled from the swamps as they clawed their way back out of the jungle. Wielding Cursed Blades that spread fear and corruption, the Drowned Dead are an Endless Horde, crawling out of the shadows to overwhelm the living!  

**Trolls**  
One of the main Enemies that Viking Heroes will face in the Gates of Valhalla Brimstone Adventures Set are the monstrous and hateful Trolls of the Norse Lands! These hulking, Mythic Beasts live in the wild lands of the north, attacking nearby villages and ambushing unwary travelers to feed on. With jagged claws and a satchel of hefty boulders to throw, Trolls spread fear throughout the dark forests and icy crags they call home. Able to Regenerate even the most gruesome injuries, an angry Troll can be a terrifying foe to face, let alone a group of them.  

**Deep Stalkers**  
Deep Stalkers are terrifying fish-men, emerging from the deep dark below the churning surface of the sea! With both gills and lungs, these slimy fiends are equally at home in water or on land. They climb aboard ships that stray into their domain, attacking the crew and stealing their supplies (as well as kidnapping the occasional crewman for their dark feedings).  

**Leviathan Tentacles**  
Leviathan Tentacles are the long, squid-like tentacles of a massive Leviathan, submerged below the surface of the water. These long Tentacles rise up from the deep to attack Heroes at sea, or those that linger too close to the coastlines.  

**Gremians**  
One of the new enemies featured in the Gates of Valhalla Shadows of Brimstone Adventures set, is the Gremians!  The set contains 12 of these small impish little demons, and they are nasty little guys!  This is a closer look at the miniature sculpt.  We named these guys for the Olde English word Gremian, which later evolved into the word Gremlin.  But any way you spell or pronounce it, they mean business.  Specifically, the business of trouble-making!  Each Gremian in Gates of Valhalla is armed with a sturdy little knife to poke, stick, and stab at heroes, and little clawed fingers and toes that can scratch at any heroes who cross paths with them!   

Gremians can be found to infest many different Worlds, whether hiding among the snow-covered trees of the Norse Lands, or lurking in the shadowy corners and dark halls of the ancient city of the Targa Plateau.  
### Faction: Setaris Kitewings

**Setaris Ravagers**  
The Setaris Kitewings are a ruthless alien civilization, bent on conquest and devastation. A reptilian species with large, leathery wings, they descend from above to rain death upon their foes. Often acting in small bands of space pirates known as Ravager Enclaves, these cunning raiders have mastered Hit-and-Run attacks to strike quickly and without warning. Not known for taking prisoners, it is said that the Setaris have a habit of feeding on the dead.  

The Setaris Kitewings were first introduced in the Conquest of Planet Earth board game as one of the many Alien Races that players could control in their bid to conquer 1950's Earth. A reptilian species, the Setaris soar through the sky with their swooping wings and lashing tails, chittering and cawing to each other through their long vicious beaks filled with razor sharp teeth. But do not let their savage and monstrous demeanor fool you; they are an advanced civilization, ruthless in their desire for conquest, wielding dangerous technologies and armed with powerful weapons.  

Though not particularly tough, the Setaris Ravagers can strike fast and hard, blasting the Heroes with their Setaris Laser Rifles before closing in to scratch and claw with their talons. These sinister Enemies use the rules for Snap Fire,  giving them the opportunity to make a free Ranged Attack each turn before closing in on the Heroes to use their Combat; then falling back to a distance to be ready to start the process again the following turn. And, with their Masters of Snap Fire ability, the Ravagers are even harder to pin down than other Enemies that use Snap Fire. They are also quite fast as they fly through the air, evading damage with their Agile Dodge.  

As Alien pirates, enclaves of Setaris Ravagers can be found across the  galaxy, looting and pillaging travelers and settlements, then disappearing as quickly as they arrived. To represent this, the Setaris  Ravagers Enemy Pack includes OtherWorld Threat Cards for encountering them in the Swamps of Jargono, Blasted Wastes, the Targa Plateau, and the Derelict Ship, as well as the standard Threat cards for Low, Med, and High threats.  
### Faction: The Trun

**Trun Outcasts**  
Part of a brutish warrior race of reptilian soldiers, the Trun tower over humans, standing around 10' tall. With rippling muscles and a thick scaled hide, the Trun are the ultimate hunters in the galaxy, using brutal weapons and wearing heavy armor plating. They seek out deadly prey to test their skills, living and fighting in tribes of armored warriors.  

Sometimes, when a member of a Trun hunting pack becomes disgraced or fails in a critical hunt, they are banished from the tribe, an outcast to their people. These warriors often seek out a glorious death in combat or travel great distances to stalk the deadliest prey alive. But some... some choose to take on a new life. A life of adventure...danger...the life of a Hero! Or maybe just a mercenary. If the pay is high and the chance of glorious death is higher, a Trun Outcast can rarely say no.  

### Faction: The Scafford Gang

The Scafford Gang are the most notorious mutant outlaws in the Southwest! Making their hideouts in the old caves and mines around the ruins of Brimstone, they have becoming grossly mutated by the cursed radiation of the Dark Stone. As their infamy grows, so too do their ranks, welcoming in any fellow mutants that have been ousted by the locals or that are just looking to make a dishonest buck!  

Lead by Colonel Scafford and his original gang of confederates (including his miscreant sons), the Scafford Gang mostly loots travelers on the road, knocks over frontier town banks, and raids caravans for their gold and precious Dark Stone cargo. But when it comes to bigger heists, the Colonel’s daughter, Captain Belle Scafford, rides out with her mutant Outriders to race down Trains in search of the big scores.  

**Belle Scafford**  
Favorite Daughter of the Colonel, Captain Belle Scafford is an expert horsemen, deadly duelist with a sabre, and a rogue of the highest order. She has a twinkle in her eye, and a cutthroat smile, with a ruthless disposition. Many men have died underestimating her skill, both on horseback and with a blade. Quick on the draw, she never shoots a man in the back… they are rarely fast enough to turn and run.  

**Scafford Outriders**  
The Scafford Outriders are mutant train robbers that descend from the hills to hit the rail lines that run through the valleys and gulches near Brimstone. Riding thunderous horses tainted by the Void energy of the black rock, these wild outlaws use their weird and wondrous mutations to great effect during a heist. With slippery skin to squeeze through the train’s windows, flailing tentacles to climb onto the rooftops, or extra limbs to hold up several passengers at once, they hit and run, leaving only a slimy trail and the faint echo of cackling laughter in their wake.  

**Safecrackers**  
When extra muscle is needed to tear the doors off a train or rip a steel safe to pieces, the Safecrackers always get the job done. These hulking mutants can charge up alongside a train, running at full bore before making a massive leap to land on the Rooftop. With meaty barbed claws and rippling muscle, they can shred right through anything that stands in their way, whether it’s the side of a train car, a reinforced bank safe, or even the unfortunate marshals that try to stop them. No cage can keep them in, no wall can keep them out.  

**Morty Scafford**  
Though afflicted with a hideous troll body and diminutive size, Mortimer J. Scafford makes up for his shortcomings by being the best heist planner and safe breaker in the West. Armed with the tools of the trade and a custom stethoscope for fine detail work, he often rides into battle perched atop one of the massive mutant Safecrackers to get him where he needs to be. Planning every heist down to the last detail, Morty Scafford leaves nothing to chance. If you think you know what he’s going to do, he’s most likely already been and gone, and he probably stole your wallet too.  

### Faction: Pharrox Vampires

**Queen of the Dead**  
Ruling monarch of the last Dynasty of Pharrox, Ariandra the Third, Queen of the Dead, retreated into her inner sanctum as the towers burned and the foundations of the city were torn apart by Dark Stone explosions from sabotage within and a fierce onslaught above. As the entire island crumbled and slid beneath the surface into the watery depths, she swore an oath of vengeance on all those that opposed the mighty Kingdom of Pharrox and her bloodline.  

**Dynastic Guard**  
Heavily armored royal guardsmen of the crimson court, the Queen’s Dynastic Guard defended the gleaming spires of Pharrox Atlantea to the last moments before the kingdom fell. Bred for battle, only the largest and fiercest fighters would be granted the honor of the court’s chosen, often dueling to the First Blood Feed for position amongst their ranks.  

**Atlantean Automaton Warriors**  
For thousands of years, the mechanical warriors of Pharrox marched to war for their vampiric masters, sweeping away all opposition before the might of their unyielding blades. Using shimmering gateways, the armies of Pharrox would appear from the sea to crush any that would dare defy them. Unbothered by the harsh light of the sun above, these soldiers were relentless in battle. Once the island city toppled into the sea, they found new purpose in the dark halls of the submerged ruins, watching over the twilight slumber of their masters for millennia until the kingdom was ready for a new call to war.  

**Court Artificer**  
Masters of Atlantean technology and super science, the Court Artificers maintained the Kingdom’s defensive batteries of burning mirrors and legions of Automaton warriors. Brilliant tacticians and cunning fighters, the Artificers wield electrified polearms that are both tools of their trade and deadly weapons charged with Void energy.  

### Faction: Order of the Crimson Hand

The Order of the Crimson Hand has a long and rich history of seeking out ancient relics and sinister offerings to unlock forbidden lore and the power of dark gods. These Acolytes of occult knowledge have devoted their souls to unlocking the secrets of these twisted and dark magiks. Carrying scrolls writ in tainted blood and runic amulets imbued with chaotic potential, the Dark Acolytes of the Crimson Hand set up wicked altars and lead depraved rituals aimed to summon demonic creatures and unleash this raw  power for their own nefarious goals.

Carrying scrolls writ in tainted blood and runic amulets imbued with chaotic potential, the Dark Acolytes of the Crimson Hand set up wicked altars and lead depraved rituals aimed to summon demonic creatures and unleash this raw power for their own nefarious goals.  

The Dark Acolytes bring another facet of the sinister Order of the Crimson Hand into the game. Tasked with preparing the occult rituals and dark altars of the Order, these Acolytes are steeped in Arcane Lore, using scrolls and amulets to gain Runic Protection and to unleash spells on the Heroes. Arcane Magik is a new Spell Deck that allows the Dark Acolytes to summon Demons or Undead to the Fight, launch bolts of Arcane Energy, or even allow one of them to ignite their hand ablaze with a crimson fire to attack, a burning effigy of the ancient Master of the Order, Shi-Hai Da’kal. Though not as tough as their more numerous cultist brethren, Dark Acolytes are every bit as zealous, using arcane lore and forbidden knowledge to attack the Heroes.  


**Dread Inquisitors**  

Dread Inquisitors are part of the ancient Order of the Crimson Hand - a secret cult that has been around for centuries.  They are dark masters of pestilence, wielding vile plagues to unleash upon any that would stand in the way of their sinister plans!  Fueled by Dread, they are brutal and menacing, wielding metal  "man catcher" pole arms and some also carry long, curved blades for rending flesh from bodies!  They hold themselves with an air of confidence because no one dares to question their authority.  

The Inquisitors are the most feared and deadly branch of the Crimson Hand; a shadowy and sinister organization, even within the already secretive Order.  While most of the Crimson Hand are dedicated to seeking out ancient and occult artifacts to use in their dark rituals, the Dread Inquisitors of the Pestilarium Morbus are masters of death. Guiding and harnessing many of the worst plagues in human history, their goal is to control life and death itself, through the manipulation of disease and pestilence.  Wearing heavy layered robes, leather gloves, and menacing masks, the Dread Inquisitors are protected from the terrifying plagues they cultivate and spread. They are ruthless in their methods of death and destruction, and once you see them, it may already be too late!  


### Faction: Targa Robots

**Targa Librarian**  
The Targa Librarians are sinister alien robots that preside over the Library Archives of the Targa Plateau. Guided by the Artificial Intelligence of the central Data Core, these caretakers float through the icy abandoned halls of the technological repository, gathering new information to add to Targa's vast Library of ancient knowledge.  

Standing more than 3 meters tall, they tower over most other robotic servants and drones within the hallowed halls. Connected directly to the Intelligence, the Librarians of Targa are its physical avatars that move about the Archive, managing the systems and controlling the lesser automatons. Though responsible for much of the Archive's upkeep and organization, the Librarians are also equipped with some of the most advanced technology and weapons that the Library has to offer. Unwitting explorers soon discover that the Librarians of Targa are just as cold and ruthlessly efficient at dealing with intruders as they are at filing new entries into the data columns of the Archive.  

The Targa Librarians can be one of the most deadly Enemies in Shadows of Brimstone, and that's saying something. Often appearing as a mini-Boss, the Librarians use their ancient technology for both powerful defense as well as deadly attacks. Whenever a Targa Librarian enters play, it draws one of the three cards from the Codex deck to determine what style of Librarian you are facing - Adjutant, Moderator, or Recordkeeper. This Codex modifies the Librarian's weapons and abilities, as well as its behavior in the fight.  

Covered in *Ceraphin Plating* to reduce the effectiveness of Critical Hits, and equipped with an Ancient Forcefield that deflects a good amount of Damage from every incoming attack, a Librarian can be difficult to damage. This combined with its Codex weapons and high Combat and Damage values, as well as its Adaptive Strategy, make the Librarian a terrifying foe to face.  

The Gates of Valhalla Adventure set comes with 3 Targa Librarian miniatures that can be assembled as one of each Codex. Usually Heroes will only fight 1 Librarian at a time, though some exceptionally dangerous fights may include up to 3 Librarians (which means you had better have your affairs in order).   

**Centurion**  
When ancient sensors are tripped by unwary intruders, detachments of long-dormant, robotic Centurions come to life. Stepping out of their charging alcoves, they march to battle in defense of the frozen city. Armed with Power Swords and Blast Shields, these defenders of the Targa Plateau are ruthless in their cold and calculating tactics.  

Targa Centurions attack in groups, relentlessly marching toward the Heroes in a column of armored might. They have no remorse and give no quarter to their foes, only death. In battle, the Centurions' Power Swords slice through Armor and flesh, while blows deflected by their Blast Shield can cause a concussive burst of energy able to knock their attacker across the room!   

### Faction: Trederra

**Trederran MK IIs 'Lightning' Scout Tank**  
Feared across the battlefields of Trederra, the Mk IIs "Lightning' Scout Tank rolls over trenches and rumbles down burnt out streets in search of the enemy. Grinding gears and plumes of black smoke bellow from the steel beast as it scouts ahead of an armored column, or lends its deadly firepower as infantry support to the Legionnaires. Though smaller than most of the massive tanks of Trederra, the Lightning is more maneuverable, and fueled by Dark Stone, it still packs a punch. It is one of the only Tanks routinely used for excursions into OtherWorlds when the mission calls for overwhelming fire support.

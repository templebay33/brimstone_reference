# Shadows of Brimstone - Skirmish Homebrew

## Goals
This will go over the goals of creating a fun set of skirmish game rules using the miniatures and lore from Shadows of Brimstone. There are several goals for the design of this fan-made skirmish game:  

- A minimal set of core rules that can fit on just a few pages.
- Short play times for an average skirmish match of 60 minutes or less.
- Designed to play on common 2D battle maps using a square grid.
- Keep table clutter and the number of components that need to be set up for a match low.
- Keep downtime short for each player, so that players don't have to wait long before they get to participate in the game.
- Contain a roughly 60/40 mix of skill versus luck. 
- Offer a medium amount of tactical and strategic depth, but not so many variables in decision-making that players play slow.

The ability to fit all of the core rules onto just two pages is important. People should be able to casually learn the game as they play very quickly and find things intuitive and simple. It's okay if things outside of the core rules such as scenarios, army building, and unit profiles are not included in the two pages. But all of the rules for taking turns, activating units, moving, combat, and managing resources should fit in just two pages or less.  

2D battle maps are much cheaper and easier to store than 3D terrain. Maps with a square grid is more common when trying to find battle maps to purchase from artists and publishers. 2D battle maps are awkward to use for a lot of vertical movement, so there is no need to have rules for things like climbing, jumping, and falling.   

Keeping table clutter low is helpful. We want to avoid having a lot of tokens, cards, charts, and other things to set up in order to play. The map, the models, some dice, unit profile references, and maybe a small handful of tokens/markers should be all thats needed. The design should stick to only using generic D6 dice, and any tokens used should come from those available in the normal Shadows of Brimstone board game.  

Keeping downtime short generally means only activating one unit at a time before the other player gets to take a turn, as well as ensuring the rules and the game isn't so complex that players need a lot of time to quietly think and evaluate all of their options.  

The tactical and strategic layer of the game should help the more skilled players to win more often, but less skilled players should always have a good chance to win occasional matches if luck is on their side. The goal is for players of different skill levels to be able to play together and both have fun.   

The level of tactical and strategic depth to the game needs to greater than what is offered in the Shadows of Brimstone board game. But we want to avoid making the rules complex in order to achieve that depth, which will drag down the tempo of the gameplay. Players should have opportunities for clever tactics and strategies and feel themselves becoming more skilled as they continue to play the game.  

### Goal - Incentavize Movement & Positioning
One big difference from the mechanics of the board game is that players should be incentivized to keep moving and re-positioning their models to their advantage instead of standing in the same place. The best tactical position should generally require the player to move each unit to a new position each time it is activated to keep the game feeling dynamic.  

### Goal - Resource Management
Having a resource to manage over the course of a match is a key ingredient in a great skirmish game because it is one of the best ways to mix longer-term strategic planning in with short term tactical planning. There should only be a single resource to gain/spend/manage in the game and the rules for it should be simple. But being good at using the resource for maximum effect should have a big impact on who wins the match.  

### Goal - Adjustable Tempo
Players should be able to impact the tempo of the game for their advantage. This could be things like being able to take bigger activations at certain times, push harder at the expense of resources or greater risk, etc. But there should be some mechanism within the game rules which provide a way for players to affect the tempo of how agressive or conservative they play.  

### Goal - Asymetrical Unit Design
Units should be designed with a rock-paper-scissors approach in mind. That is, a typical unit design will have situations in which they excel, and situations which they struggle, as opposed to a "jack of all trades" approach. A typical match can be made more dynamic and interesting if the opposing playings have units on their team that are strong against some units on the opposing side, and weak against others. This can sometimes create a more fun "cat-and-mouse" kind of feel to the gameplay where units are naturally incentivised to keep moving around the map for a better position so that they can chase down opposing units they are strong against while trying to avoid being chased down by ones they are weak against. For example, a U.S. Marshal unit with a long range rifle might be strong against tough, slow moving enemies. But the extra focus it takes the Marshal to aim their rifle for accuracy makes them vulnerable to quick flanking attacks by fast, melee focused enemies. Having specific strengths and weaknesses in mind when designing units should help with this goal.  

### Goal - Opportunities for Bluffing/Misdirection
Another fun dynamic in some skirmish games is when players have ways they can attempt to misdirect their opponent. The skirmish game Bushido by GCT studios for example has players secretly allocate a pool of dice between defense and offense, only revealing when both players roll during a "melee exchange". This provides fun bluffing opportunities such as charging in for a big attack, only to allocate all dice to defense and trick the opponent into over-extending. Other games like Infinity have hidden movement mechanics which allow players to hide models on the table in an ambush position, taking a picture with their smartphone while the opposing player turns away, and then removing the model from the board. Misdirection doesn't necessarily require hidden information.  

### Goal - Low Complexity Unit Profiles
Skirmish games can have a tendency to create complex unit profiles, such as in the game Malifaux where a typical unit may have 5-6 attributes such as health, agility, movement, toughness, etc., plus several keywords with rules attached, special weapon rules for their attacks, and special unique abilities for the unit as well. This can add up to a lot of complexity that doesn't bode well for the other goals of keeping the game fast paced and easy for casual play.  

An approach I like can be found in some skirmish games such as "Song of Blades and Heroes" and "One Page Rules". Units only have 2 attributes (quality and defense for example) that are used for all of their dice tests. Additionally, they only have a single weapon built into their profile and a maximum of 3 abilities. Additionally, the abilities come from a common "pool" of abilities, meaning that the same abilities are shared by several different unit designs. This helps players more easily begin to memorize the rules for various abilities faster as they appear more often in the game, as well as making it easier to reference the rules for those abilities during play.   

The rules for all unit abilities should fit on a single double-sided reference sheet.  

## Mechanics
This section will discuss specific design mechanics of the game rules and ideas for their implementation. They are meant to provide examples and brainstorming ideas for the game rules and also work as examples for Large Language Models assisting with game design.

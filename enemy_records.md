# Shadows of Brimstone - Enemy Record Sheets
This document provides text description of all the information in the Enemy Record sheet for enemies in Shadows of Brimstone. The real enemy record sheets have graphical design elements like artwork, icons, and different fonts to indicate the type of information being displayed. This reference will use simple text only and rely on basic key/value pairs to store the same information. The intent of this reference is to provide data to AI models so that all of the rules and information contained in each Enemy Record Sheet can be easily parsed by an AI.  

The *Brutal* version of each each Enemy Record Sheet (which appears on the reverse side of the physical sheets) is also included.

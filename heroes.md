# Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference
This is a reference of all the Heroes Classes and Sub-Classes in Shadows of Brimstone. The entry for each Class contains the following inforamtion:

- Hero Class Sheet: The core stats and abilities of the Class including things like Health and Sanity values, Skill attributes like Luck and Cunning, special Class abilities, and starting items.
- Gameplay Description: A description breaking down how the Hero Class plays during an adventure, some key features unique to the Class, and perhaps some of the different options for how to play the Class according to personal taste.
- Starting Upgrades: The full text of each available Starting Upgrade available as a choice during character creation.
- Starting Gear: A list of each Starting Gear item for the Hero Class needed during character creation. Some Classes have an option of choosing different Starting Gear and some Starting Upgrades determine the Starting Gear used. There may be some Starting Gear items not given to the Hero during character creation as a result of these choices.
- Special Cards: Some Hero Classes such as the Gambler have special cards unique to that Class. If the Class has their own unique cards, they are listed here. Sometimes these cards are chosen at random during character creation, other times the player gets to pick, while other times the entire set of cards might be used from the start. These details will be explained in this section as well.
- Level Up Chart: The 2D6 chart used when rolling for bonuses gained when reaching a new experience level specific to the Hero Class.
- Upgrade Chart: A list of new Upgrades available to pick from when gaining a new experience level. Each Upgrade Chart consists of 4 separate tracks of upgrades that are related to one another both thematically and gameplay-wise. Each track has its own name and each upgrade in the track has a level. The Hero must already have obtained the lower numbered upgrades before being allowed to take higher level upgrades within the same track. For example, taking a Level 3 Upgrade requires that the Hero already have obtained the Level 1 and Level 2 Upgrades within the same track.

## U.S. Marshal Gameplay Description

U.S. Marshals are 'tough as nails' bounty hunters, working for the government. No stranger to working alone, they travel the land looking for those who need a little justice. When the need arises though, they step up to lead those around them, descending into the very depths of hell if necessary to get the job done.


U.S. Marshals are one of the toughest Hero Classes in the game. With a Defense 3+, they can easily be a frontline fighter, blocking a hall or wading into groups of Enemies, shrugging off most incoming Attacks. With their Shotgun and Double-Shot ability, a U.S. Marshal can also deal out large amounts of damage as a virtual one man army. The Marshal's Badge makes them a solid team player, waiting until just the right time to flash the Badge and give every Hero a boost to their next Attack!

The U.S. Marshal is native to the old west setting of Brimstone and first appeared in the City of Ancients Core Set. 

### Starting Upgrade Choices 

U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades focus on Recovering Grit, gaining extra XP, and Healing.

### Rolling Thunder

This ability is great for offsetting the potential ‘feast or famine’ of only getting to roll a single Shot each turn with the Shotgun. It is fantastic for making sure you always have the Grit you need to Re-roll dice and to activate your more powerful abilities as you level up.

### Cleaning Up the West 

By Cleaning Up the West, you can make sure that you are always Healing a little bit of Health and Sanity as you fight, helping you to stay alive while getting up close and personal with your Shotgun. It also gives you a boost to Max Grit and XP, giving you a leg up on Leveling Up, especially early on in your Hero’s career.

### Hardened Resolve

To focus on a more team leader style role, Hardened Resolve gives you a solid ability to Heal yourself and the rest of the posse, even at a distance. It also makes Tonic Tokens you bring along in your Side Bag far more effective.

## U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades

- **Rolling Thunder:** Any time you kill an Enemy, you may Recover a Grit on the D6 roll of 4+.
- **Hardened Resolve:** Use 1 Grit to Heal up to 4 Wounds/Sanity (any mix) total from yourself and other Heroes on your Map Tile.
- **Cleaning Up The West:** Any time you kill an Enemy you may Heal 1 Wound and 1 Sanity, and gain 10 XP. +1 Max Grit.

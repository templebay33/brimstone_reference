# Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference
This is a reference of all the Heroes Classes and Sub-Classes in Shadows of Brimstone. The entry for each Class contains the following inforamtion:

- Hero Class Sheet: The core stats and abilities of the Class including things like Health and Sanity values, Skill attributes like Luck and Cunning, special Class abilities, and starting items.
- Gameplay Description: A description breaking down how the Hero Class plays during an adventure, some key features unique to the Class, and perhaps some of the different options for how to play the Class according to personal taste.
- Starting Upgrades: The full text of each available Starting Upgrade available as a choice during character creation.
- Starting Gear: A list of each Starting Gear item for the Hero Class needed during character creation. Some Classes have an option of choosing different Starting Gear and some Starting Upgrades determine the Starting Gear used. There may be some Starting Gear items not given to the Hero during character creation as a result of these choices.
- Special Cards: Some Hero Classes such as the Gambler have special cards unique to that Class. If the Class has their own unique cards, they are listed here. Sometimes these cards are chosen at random during character creation, other times the player gets to pick, while other times the entire set of cards might be used from the start. These details will be explained in this section as well.
- Level Up Chart: The 2D6 chart used when rolling for bonuses gained when reaching a new experience level specific to the Hero Class.
- Upgrade Chart: A list of new Upgrades available to pick from when gaining a new experience level. Each Upgrade Chart consists of 4 separate tracks of upgrades that are related to one another both thematically and gameplay-wise. Each track has its own name and each upgrade in the track has a level. The Hero must already have obtained the lower numbered upgrades before being allowed to take higher level upgrades within the same track. For example, taking a Level 3 Upgrade requires that the Hero already have obtained the Level 1 and Level 2 Upgrades within the same track.

## U.S. Marshal Gameplay Description

U.S. Marshals are 'tough as nails' bounty hunters, working for the government. No stranger to working alone, they travel the land looking for those who need a little justice. When the need arises though, they step up to lead those around them, descending into the very depths of hell if necessary to get the job done.


U.S. Marshals are one of the toughest Hero Classes in the game. With a Defense 3+, they can easily be a frontline fighter, blocking a hall or wading into groups of Enemies, shrugging off most incoming Attacks. With their Shotgun and Double-Shot ability, a U.S. Marshal can also deal out large amounts of damage as a virtual one man army. The Marshal's Badge makes them a solid team player, waiting until just the right time to flash the Badge and give every Hero a boost to their next Attack!

The U.S. Marshal is native to the old west setting of Brimstone and first appeared in the City of Ancients Core Set. 

### Starting Upgrade Choices 

U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades focus on Recovering Grit, gaining extra XP, and Healing.

### Rolling Thunder

This ability is great for offsetting the potential ‘feast or famine’ of only getting to roll a single Shot each turn with the Shotgun. It is fantastic for making sure you always have the Grit you need to Re-roll dice and to activate your more powerful abilities as you level up.

### Cleaning Up the West 

By Cleaning Up the West, you can make sure that you are always Healing a little bit of Health and Sanity as you fight, helping you to stay alive while getting up close and personal with your Shotgun. It also gives you a boost to Max Grit and XP, giving you a leg up on Leveling Up, especially early on in your Hero’s career.

### Hardened Resolve

To focus on a more team leader style role, Hardened Resolve gives you a solid ability to Heal yourself and the rest of the posse, even at a distance. It also makes Tonic Tokens you bring along in your Side Bag far more effective.

## U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades

- **Rolling Thunder:** Any time you kill an Enemy, you may Recover a Grit on the D6 roll of 4+.
- **Hardened Resolve:** Use 1 Grit to Heal up to 4 Wounds/Sanity (any mix) total from yourself and other Heroes on your Map Tile.
- **Cleaning Up The West:** Any time you kill an Enemy you may Heal 1 Wound and 1 Sanity, and gain 10 XP. +1 Max Grit.

## Gambler Gameplay Description
Gamblers may not have won the West, but they had the most fun winning the war of words and wits around the card table in saloons and gambling halls across the new frontier! With nimble fingers, a cunning smile, and an elaborate plan, looking three steps ahead, a Gambler is more than just a simple showman or performer; he's an artist. Lying, cheating, and stealing is all part of the show when you're reputation as a card shark and scoundrel is on the line, and no Gambler worth his salt would let a little thing like honesty get in the way of the next big score.

The gambler is all about sleight of hand, card and dice manipulation, and gaming the system using his Gambling Tricks. He's not the toughest fighter or fastest gun around, but with a bit of fortune on his side, he can pull off cunning combos and lucky maneuvers that other Heroes wouldn't even dream possible. This makes him a fun Hero for players who like to think outside the rules...not cheating per se (most of the time anyway), but bending and twisting them, with a wink and a smile.

## Gambler Starting Upgrade Choices
Gambler Starting Upgrades focus on recovering Fortune Tokens, movement, and Luck.

### Fancy Footwork
This upgrade gives the Gambler a significant speed boost to get where he needs to go, as well as a better level of control over Recovering Grit. It also has a moderate chance of Recovering Fortune Tokens.

### Side Bet
A natural betting man, the Gambler is compusively looking for ways to play the odds. This upgrade gives you a built in Luck bonus (which the Gambler tends to use...a lot) but only has a low level chance for Recovering Fortune Tokens.

### High Roller
With a lucky streak of high rolls, this upgrade can pay off in spades, giving you the extra Damage you need to capitalize on your Critical Hits for maximum effect! It also gives a high level chance for Recovering Fortune Tokens.


## Gambler Starting Upgrades

- **Side Bet:** +1 Luck. When making any Skill test (Cunning, Luck, Spirit, etc.), if you roll three of a kind, Recover 1 Fortune Token. However, if you roll three 1s, lose D3 Fortune Tokens instead.
- **Fancy Footwork:** You may roll an extra die for Move each turn, and choose which to use. If doubles are rolled on your Move dice, also Recoter 1 Fortune Token.
- **High Roller:** Your To Hit rolls of 6+ do +1 Damage. Once per turn, when you Recover a Grit, you may also Recover 1 Fortune Token.


## Gambler Starting Gear

### Pistol
- **Keywords:** Gear, Gun, Pistol
- **Range:** 6
- **Shots:** 2
- **Gold Sell Value:** $100
- **Weight:** 1
- **Upgrade Slots:** 2
- **Hand Slots:** Single Handed

## Gambler Rules Notes

### Poker Face Ability
The Gamblers Poker Face ability allows them to gain extra Gold when gambling in Town. This ability may only be used once per location visit, regardless of how many individual times you participate in a gambling event during that visit.
### Fortune Tokens
Fortune is a unique resource specific to the Gambler Hero Class. Special Fortune Tokens are included with the Gambler Hero Pack to track the amount of Fortune the Hero currently has during gameplay. 

Fortune is used to activate Gambling Tricks. A Gambler starts each adventure with max Fortune and only regains them through "Catching Your Breath" after a Fight, or from abilities.

The Gambler has a Fortune value which is the number of Fortune Tokens he/she starts each adventure and travel with, as well as the max number of fortune tokens he can have at one time.

Fortune Tokens are generally only recovered when Catching Your Breath after a Fight and by certain abilities. Whenever you Catch Your Breath after a Fight, you may Recover D3 Fortune Tokens. Note that modifiers to Catching Your Breath (such as in the Swamps of Jargono) do NOT affect recovering Fortune.

## Gambler Gambling Tricks
Gambling Tricks are special ability cards unique to the Gambler Hero class. Upon Hero creation, the Gambler always starts with the Fortune's Favor Gambling Trick and one random Gambling Trick. The Gambler may earn additional Gambling Tricks when leveling up during a campaign. Each Gambling Trick may only be used once per turn, as well as once during Traveling and once per Town Stay. The "Fortune's Favor" gambling trick is an exception though, and may be used once during traveling as well as once PER DAY in Town.

Some Gambling Tricks have XP values. This XP is awarded to the Gambler Hero whenever they successfully pass the skill test mentioned on the Gambling Trick.

Each Gambling Trick on its cown can be very powerful, but they can often be combined in fun and creative ways to achieve outstanding and death-defying results!

Whenever the Gambler gains a new Grambling Trick, he may draw two cards and then choose one to keep, returning the other to the box.

Here is the complete list of Gambling Trick cards and their text:
### Fortune's Favor
  - Starting Trick.
  - Use 1 Fortune Token to re-roll any single die just rolled, even if it has already been re-rolled. 
  - This may not target a die that is specifically excluded from using Grit on (such as Hold Back the Darkness)
  - XP: N/A

### Stack The Deck
  - Use 1 Fortune Token to choose any card deck, then make a Cunning 6+ test. If passed, look at the top 3 cards of that deck. Choose one to discard and put the other two back on top of the deck, in any order.
  - This may not be used on decks that have no discard pile (such as Loot or Scavenge).
  - XP: 10

### Tip the Scales
  - Use 1 Fortune Token to choose any single die just rolled, and make a Luck 5+ test. For each 5+ rolled, you may add or subtract 1 from the chosen die roll.
  - This may not target a die that is specifically excluded from using Grit on (such as Hold Back the Darkness), and may not adjust the die to be higher or lower than it could have naturally rolled.
  - XP: 10

### Double Down
  - Once per Fight, use 1 Fortune Token when you are about to make a Damage roll for one of your Hits.
  - Double the amount rolled for Damage (before any modifiers). If the target would not be killed by this Hit, the Hit does no Damage instead.
  - XP: N/A

### Bluff
  - Use 1 Fortune Token when you are about to be Attacked by an Enemy (before dice are rolled), to make a Luck 6+ test.
  - If passed, that Attack is canceled. If failed, all Hits from that Attack are +1 Damage against you.
  - XP: 20

### Ace in the Hole
  - If there is no die here, use 1 Fortune Token when you roll a 6 on any single die to place that die here. Roll a new die to replace the 6 that was rolled.
  - While there is a die here, use 1 Fortune Token to make a Luck 5+ test. If passed, replace any single die just rolled with the 6 that was here (removing the die).
  - XP: 10

### Counting Cards
  - Use 1 Fortune Token just after a card has been drawn from any deck, and make a Cunning 6+ test.
  - If passed, place that card here facedown, and draw a new card to play instead. Any card already here is placed back in its proper deck, D3 cards down from the top of the deck.
  - XP: 15

Gambling Tricks that allow you to re-roll or modify dice may be used on any dice, not just your own, including Enemy To Hit rolls, another Her's To Hit or Defense rolls, etc.

# Bandido

## Bandido Hero Class Sheet

- **Name:** Bandido
- **Keywords:** Outlaw
- **To Hit (Range):** 5+
- **To Hit (Melee):** 4+
- **Combat:** 2
- **Max Grit:** 2
- **Initiative:** 3
- **Health:** 16
- **Sanity:** 18
- **Defense:** 4+
- **Willpower:** 5+
- **Agility:** 2
- **Cunning:** 1
- **Spirit:** 3
- **Strength:** 4
- **Lore:** 3
- **Luck:** 2
- **Starting Items:**  Pistol
- **Abilities:**
  - *Wild Card* - You may Recover a Grit on a Move roll of 1 or 2.


## Bandido Gameplay Description
With a healthy mix of stubbornness, a raging temper, and a lust for life, Bandidos are unpredicatable to say the least. Between blasting away at everything in sight with a hail of bullets and casually tossing dynamite across the room, there's never a dull moment when a Bandido is in the group!

Bandidos are truly a wild card in that they can be played in so many different ways. Their built-in ability to recover Grit mixed with a low Ranged To Hit value means that the Bandido tends to roll a lot of dice, and then Re-roll a lot of dice just to blow things up. This gives them a lot of swing in luck, but makes for a fun adventure! It also means that they rarely have a shortage of Grit for activating abilities or using more powerful Grit-based Items they find along the way.

## Bandido Starting Upgrade Choices
The Bandido Starting upgrades each focus on a completely different aspect of the character and vastly change how he feels to play.

### Explosives Expert
The ability to create Dynamite Tokens using Grit allows the Bandido to blow up anything in sight (though sometimes this includes the other Heroes too, or even himself). The added bonus of starting with the Dynamite Satchel allows you to hold an abundance of explosives as well.

### Swindler
Focusing more on collecting Loot and hand-to-hand, this ability shifts the Bandido into a strong Melee fighter. This circumvents your low Ranged To Hit value by simply encouraging you to get up close and personal.

### Twin Guns
This ability is ideal if you want to roll a lot of dice! With two Pistols, the Bandido can unleash a serious Barrage, even if he doesn't hit much. But hey, that's what Grit is for. It also compensates for a low Ranged To Hit value by getting more dice and more potential Critical Hits.


## Gambler Starting Upgrades

- **Explosives Expert:** Use 2 Grit to gain a Dynamyte Token. You also gain: Free Attack (Once per Adventure) - Throw Dynamite. Extra Starting Gear: Dynamite Satchel (with 2 Dynamite Tokens).
- **Swindler:** Once per turn, when drawing one or more Loot cards, you may choose one to discard and draw a new one. +1 Combat.
- **Twin Guns:** You may fire two single-handed Guns per turn, ignoring the penalty for Duel Wielding. Extra Starting Gear: Pistol (In addition to the first Pistol).


## Gambler Starting Gear

### Pistol
- **Keywords:** Gear, Gun, Pistol
- **Range:** 6
- **Shots:** 2
- **Gold Sell Value:** $100
- **Weight:** 1
- **Upgrade Slots:** 2
- **Hand Slots:** Single Handed

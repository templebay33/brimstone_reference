# Shadows of Brimstone - Rules Compilation

This is a text reference of rules compilation for Shadows of Brimstone. The core game rules across all Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been merged into a single reference that is not specific to any particular Core Set or Adventure Set. Additional rules across expansions is also included. The only rules not included in this reference are text on various game cards, charts, Missions, Hero Sheets, and Enemy Reference Sheets. These references can be found in separate documents.  

Note that many of the official game rules in PDF and printed format include visual elements such as icons, thematic artwork, graphic design elements, and diagrams that are not included in this text-only version of the rules.  

This text-only version of the rules is intended to be easily referenced by AI models as training data and reference information for context. As a result, the formatting may be more flat and simple, but less visually readable for humans.  

Since many AI models cannot currently work with other data types than text (such as images, video, and audio), important image data for explaining the rules are given text keywords with text-based descriptions. These visual elements, such as icons, tokens, markers, and diagrams, are summarized with a keyword or letter in curly braces {} throughout the rules. As a short-hand, text descriptions of each symbol and other visual element is provided for AI models in the list below:  

- {P}: Peril Die Icon. This depicts a yellow 6-sided die. The Peril Die is larger and physically distinct from the other D6 dice that come with the game, and has embossed number values with a worn, frayed background etched into the die. The Peril Die does not use standard 1-6 values, but instead has the following values on its 6 faces: 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. Whenever the game official game rules display a visual icon of the Peril Die, this reference will use {P} instead.
- {C}: Clue Icon. Clue icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens. Visually the look like a small red circle with a white exclamation mark in the center and a bit of drop shadow around the circle. Clue icons can have a somewhat abstract meaning depending on the context of the mission being played. Most missions will assign some special meaning to Clue Icons found on Exploration Tokens during a Mission.
- {Gate}: Gate Icon. Gate icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate that there is a gate instead of a door connected to the currently explored Map Tile which leads to an OtherWorld. The gate icon itself looks like a circular swirl of blue light.  
- {Door}: Door icon. Door icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate the number of doorways on the currently explored Map Tile are open and lead to more Map Tiles. All other puzzle-cut edges of a Map Tile are closed with an End Cap tile if they do not depict either a Door or a Gate.
- {One Hero}: One Hero icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a skill test to indicate that a single Hero chosen by the players must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with the white silhouette of a person in the center.
- {All Heroes}: All Heroes icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that all Heroes must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with one white silhouette of a person in the center and two additional grey silhouettes on either side of the white one.
- {One Random}: One Random icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that a Hero must be chosen at random to take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with a white question mark on the left and a white silhouette of a person on the right.
- {One Handed}: One Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires one hand available to be equipped. It looks like a square icon of a worn slab of wood with a black hand icon in the center foreground.
- {Double Handed}: Double Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires both hands to be available to be equipped. It looks like a rectangular icon of a worn slab of wood with two black hand icons in the foreground, side by side.
- {Anvil}: Weight icon. Indicates units of weight of a particular item if carried by a Hero. The icon is transparent and has no background, but it in the simple shape of a black anvil as seen from a side perspective.
- {Dark Stone}: Dark Stone icon. Often indicates that an Item is charged with Dark Stone energy and will require a Hero carrying the item to occasionally take Corruption Hits. It looks like a round circular icon with a dark purple background and a white chunk of crystal in the center foreground.
- {Upgrade Slot}: Upgrade Slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is able to be upgraded and has upgrade capacity equal to the number of slots depicted on the icon. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots depicted. The icon looks like a horizontal series of circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series.
- {Upgrade Required Slot}: Upgrade required slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is itself an upgrade, and will occupy a number of Upgrade Slots depicted by the icon when attached to an item. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots required. The icon looks like a horizontal series of filled in circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series of circles. 

## Game Overview
Shadows of Brimstone is a fast-paced, Cooperative, dungeon-crawl boardgame with set in a variety of fantastic worlds. Each player creates a character. Forming a party of Heroes, the players take their characters on great adventures.  

Missions are designed for maximum replayability as everything you encounter, including the board layout, is dynamically generated as the story unfolds. Explore the various worlds and locations, overcoming dangerous encounters and fighting ruthless creatures, while collecting useful Gear and ancient Artifacts to aid in your adventures. Heroes can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their expedition on the other side.  

With a robust campaign system, Hero characters can be kept from game to game, earning experience and going up in levels to increase their skills and gain new abilities. The Heroes can also visit Towns, and sometimes Cities and Expedition Camps, spending their hard earned money on goods and services.  

So unfurl the sails, take up your sword, and strap on your armor, the Darkness closes in, adventure awaits!  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. If combining a Core Set or Adventure Set with another Core Set or additional Hero Packs, this can be increased to 5-6 players. All of the players work together against the game itself and the difficulty is scaled based on the number of Heroes taking part in each adventure.

## Dice
The game comes with 16 standard six-sided dice (8 White and 8 Red) that should be divided amongst the players. There are two colors of dice included, as often players will want to roll a group of dice together with some of them being special (ex. - “the Red dice are for Critical Hits”). Often cards will refer to the terms D6 and D3. D6 is just another name for a six-sided die. D3 means to roll a six-sided die using the following results:  

- 1-2 = 1
- 3-4 = 2
- 5-6 = 3

### Re-rolls
There are many things in the game that let you Re-roll one or more dice. It is important to note though that:  
**You may not Re-roll the same die more than once.**  

### 8-Sided Die
The game also comes with an 8-sided die which is used for some special rolls. This die is often referred to as a D8.  

### Peril Die {P}
There is also a larger, special six-sided die included called the Peril Die. This die is marked with the numbers 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. It is most often used for determining the quantity of Enemies during an attack, and is represented on cards as a {P} symbol.  

## Wounds and Sanity Damage
Red Wound Markers are placed on Heroes and Enemies to keep track of how much damage they have taken during the game, while blue Sanity markers are placed on Heroes to show how much Sanity Damage they have taken. There are individual Wound/Sanity Markers as well as larger markers representing 5 Wounds/Sanity each.  

## Ability Tokens
The term Ability Token is used to refer to
any of the various special tokens used by Hero
Classes to trigger their unique abilities.  

## Ambition Tokens
Conquistador Heroes use a special Ability Token called Ambition. Similar to Grit, it allows them a Re-roll, but for just a single die, with a powerful bonus.  

## Dark Stone
These markers are used to keep track of Dark Stone shards that Heroes find on their adventures.  

## Grit
Grit is a resource that Heroes have that can be used for Re-rolling dice, activating special abilities, or adding a burst of speed to your movement. 

Grit is a resource that represents a Hero’s
ability to tough out difficult situations and pull
off amazing feats; dodging a fatal blow at the
last minute, scoring a particularly difficult hit,
or activating a powerful special ability to save
the day. In short, it allows Heroes to be heroic!
Every Hero has Grit (they wouldn’t be much of
a Hero without it).  

### Using Grit
A Hero may use a Grit to do one of three things:
- Use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of dice that your
Hero just rolled.
- Use 1 Grit to add an extra D6 to your Hero’s
Movement.
- Use Grit to activate a Special Ability or Item that
requires it.


### Re-roll Limits
Grit can be very useful for Re-rolling dice when you need
to, but it is important to remember that no single die may ever
be Re-rolled more than once. So, for example, you CANNOT
Re-roll all of your misses with a Grit, and then use an ability or
spend another Grit to Re-roll the ones that still missed.
Grit may only be used to Re-roll dice that have been
rolled for your Hero (not other Heroes, Enemies, etc).
In Addition, Grit may not be used on any roll on a Chart
or the roll to Hold Back the Darkness (more on that later).  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is a very powerful resource, but is limited. Each
Hero starts every Mission with 1 Grit, but more can be gained
throughout the Adventure. The most common way to Recover
a Grit is by rolling a 1 for your Move roll. This is covered in
greater detail later in the section on Hero Activation.  

### Max Grit
Every Hero Class has a Max Grit listed on their Character
Sheet. This is generally Max Grit 2 for most new Heroes.
Max Grit is simply the most Grit your Hero can have at one
time.  

If you are already at your Max Grit and you would get to
Recover a Grit, though you can’t hold onto it, you are allowed
to immediately spend that new Grit instead of just losing it.
This is most often used to activate an ability that costs Grit or
to gain the extra D6 to your Move for the turn.  

## Corruption
During the game, Heroes can gain Corruption Points, slowly pushing them down the path of evil and mutation.  

## Exploration Tokens
These markers are placed face down in new rooms discovered as the Heroes explore and, when revealed, tell the number of exits a room has as well as if there are any Encounters or Enemies to be overcome there. Some also have a {C} Clue Icon.  

## Side Bags and Side Bag Tokens
Each Hero has a Side Bag that can carry helpful Tokens for them such as Bandages, Rum, or Bombs.  

## Deuling Tactics
An assortment of Dueling Tactics markers are
included to represent the different tactics that Heroes
can practice in Camp to unleash on their foes in
battle.  

## Scavenged Markers
These markers are used to show when a
Map Tile has been successfully Scavenged by the
Heroes for anything of value.  

## Revive Tokens
These tokens are occasionally used to give
Heroes an extra chance at survival, allowing a
Hero that was just KO’d to get back up
without long-lasting effects.  

## Creeping Shadows
Creeping Shadows are a type of Enemy, that
emerges from the darkness to swarm the Heroes
and attack them from within their space.  

## Hero and KO'd Hero Markers
Hero markers can be used for determining a Random
Hero from the group. KO’d Hero markers are placed in the
space where a Hero was KO’d.  

## Hero Characters
Each player must choose what type of Hero they want to play. These different Hero ‘types’ are called Classes. In some
Adventure Sets, all of the Heroes included are from a single Hero Class - (Conquistador, Viking, etc.). However, the Hero
Class is a ‘Team Hero’ Class meaning that it is a group of Heroes that all share a common background and basic abilities, but
are further defined by having several different Sub-Classes (El Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier). Each of these Sub-Classes
is still considered a Conquistador Hero, but has a unique Character Sheet with all of its basic Skills, Abilities, and Starting Gear
listed on it. Below is a list of the different elements of
a Hero Character Sheet:

### Hero Class and Sub-Class
A character’s Hero Class is the main thematic defining
factor for their Skills and Abilities. The Sub-Class for a Team
Hero further defines the theme that sets them apart from other
Heroes of that Class.  

### Keywords
A Hero’s Keywords are traits of that character. They do
not have any inherent meaning, but are referenced by other
cards and Abilities (often as restrictions for certain Items).  

### 'To Hit' Values
What the Hero needs to roll on their dice to hit Enemies
when making an Attack. There are two different To Hit values,
one for Ranged Attacks and one for Melee Attacks.  

### Combat
The base number of dice that the Hero gets to roll when
making a Melee Attack, even if they have no weapons.  

### Max Grit
The max number of Grit the Hero can have at one time.  

### Skill Attributes
There are 6 different Skills that every Hero has, Agility,
Cunning, Spirit, Strength, Lore, and Luck. These Skills are
used for making tests during the game.  

### Initiative
Initiative determines how quick a character is and how
early in the turn they get to Activate. Each turn models are
Activated in Initiative order, from highest to lowest.  

### Abilities
Every Hero Class has one or more special Abilities that
are an important part of being that Hero Class. These Abilities
are not always beneficial, but fundamentally effect how the
Hero plays.  

### Starting Items
Gear that any character of that Hero Class/Sub-Class starts
their adventuring career with.  

### Health
A representation of the Hero’s physical well being. Health
is reduced by taking Wounds. If your Health is ever reduced
to 0, you are KO’d.  

### Defense
Any time the Hero takes one or more Hits, they may
use their Defense as a saving roll against each Hit to prevent
taking Wounds.  

### Sanity
Sanity is just like Health, but for the Hero’s mental well
being. Sanity is reduced by taking Sanity Damage. Just like
Health, if your Sanity ever reaches 0, you are KO’d.  

### Willpower
Just like Defense is to Health, Willpower is a saving roll
for Sanity to prevent taking Sanity Damage or Corruption.  


## Depth Track
The Depth Track represents the general path of the Heroes and tracks how deep the Hero Party has journeyed into the wild, and how close the Darkness is to escaping and wreaking havoc on the countryside (resulting in failure for the Heroes). At the start of the game, the Hero Party marker is placed at the Entrance space on the far left of the track, while the Darkness marker is placed on the Darkness Start space on the far right.  

During the course of the game, the Hero Party marker moves down the track every time a new Map Tile is placed, as the Heroes travel deeper and deeper into the dark. The Darkness marker moves the opposite direction, up the track, as the Heroes fail to hold the Darkness at bay.  

### Visual Description of the Depth Track
The Depth Track is a flat, rectangular cardboard component about 7cm high and 22.5cm wide. Each Core Set and Adventure Set includes a cardboard Depth Track in the box, visually themed with graphic design elements to match the setting of the Core/Adventure box. Deluxe Depth track expansions are also available made out of Resin or Plastic that are 3D and intended to be painted. No matter which Depth Track is in use thematically, the spaces and mechanics are all the same no matter which one is being used. The visual style and build material of the component is purely aesthetic.  

The Depth track consists of spaces spread out horizontally across the width (22.5cm) of the track. Each "space" is a colored circle with a designated number in the center. The circular spaces are vertically staggered in an alternating pattern, such that next space to the left or right of the current space is at a diagonal angle.  

The first space on the left edge of the Depth Track is not numbered, and is labled the Entrance Space. The last space on the right edge of the Depth Track is also not numbered and is labled the Darkness Start space. All other circular space between the Entrance and Darkness Start spaces are numbered. The numbers start at 15 on the left side of the track (15 is the first space to the right of the Entrance space), and descend to space 1 on the right side of the track (the first space to the left of the Darkness Start space is the 1 space).  In this way, the numbers from left to right descend from 15 to 1.  

Spaces 15, 11, and 6 are additionally marked as Growing Dread spaces. This indicates that when the Darkness Marker reaches these spaces, a random Growing Dread card is added face-down to the Growing Dread Stack without the players looking.  

Spaces 13, 10, 8, 4, and 2 have an artistic border around the circumference of the circular space that looks like a blood spatter. These spaces are referred to as "Blood Spatter" spaces on the Depth Track and indicate that a random Darkness Card is drawn and resolved whenever the Darkness Marker lands on a Blood Spatter space.  

There are two verital lines that separate the Darkness Track into 3 stages. The first vertical line is between spaces 11 and 10, the second is between spaces 6 and 5. This separates the Depth Track into three stages. Each secton has a number at the bottom of the track. These numbers from the left side to the right side of the track are: 7+, 8+, and 9+. These numbers indicate the value that the player holding the Light Source must meet or exceed on a 2d6 roll when Holding Back the Darkness, depending on which of the 3 stages the Hero Party Marker is currently located. This would mean that if the Hero Party Marker is on the Entrance or spaces 15-11 a 7+ would need to be rolled, if the Hero Party Marker in on spaces 10-6 an 8+ would need to be rolled, and if the Hero Party Marker is on spaces 5-1 or the Darkness Start space, a 9+ would need to be rolled.  

### Stages of the Track
The Depth Track is broken into 3 Stages, and each Stage has a value printed at the bottom (the Top Stage 7+, Middle Stage 8+, and Bottom Stage 9+). As the Hero Party marker moves down the track, it passes through these different Stages, making it progressively harder for the Heroes to Hold Back the Darkness.  

### Holding Back the Darkness
At the start of each Turn, the Hero with the Light Source must roll a Hold Back  the Darkness test. The Hero rolls 2D6 and adds them together. If the number is equal to or greater than the value needed (listed at the bottom of the Stage that the Hero Party marker is currently in), the Darkness has been held and the marker does not move this turn. If the roll is less than the value needed, the Darkness moves one step forward on the track (closer to the Entrance). The Hero Party may only have one Light Source active at a time.  

Important: Grit may **not** be used to Re-roll a Hold Back the Darkness test!  

### Blood Spatter Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Blood Spatter space, the Heroes must immediately draw a Darkness card as the Darkness has grown stronger.  

### Growing Dread Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Growing Dread space, the Heroes must draw a Growing Dread card as the deadly nature of the Hero’s mission sinks in. 

Blood Spatter and Growing Dread spaces only matter for the Darkness Marker, not the Hero Party Marker.  

### Depth Events
Any time the Hero with the Light Source rolls natural doubles for the Hold Back the Darkness test, a Depth Event has occurred! Even if the roll would normally have failed, instead of moving the Darkness marker, consult the Depth Event Chart to see what has happened (the Depth Event Chart can be found on one of the large reference cards).  

There are 6 possible results on the chart, and the Event that has occurred is the one listed for the double number that was rolled (double 1s = 1 on the chart, double 2s = 2 on the chart, etc). This is usually something bad that has happened.  

Occasionally something else will require a Depth Event to be triggered (such as an Exploration Token). When this happens, simply roll a D6 to see which Depth Event is triggered.  

### Darkness Marker
This marks the current position of the Darkness on the Depth Track and moves up the track over the course of the game, as the Darkness tries to escape! The Darkness Marker always starts on the Darkness Start space unless Mission special rules say otherwise.      

### Hero Party Marker
This marks the current position of the Heroes on the Depth Track and moves down the track as the Heroes explore the map. The Hero Party Marker always starts on the Entrance space, unless Mission special rules say otherwise.

## The Game Turn
Each Game Turn has four steps that are completed in the
following order:  

1. Hold Back the Darkness
2. Models Activate in Initiative Order
3. Room Exploration
4. End of the Turn

Once all 4 steps are complete, a new Game Turn begins.  

### Hold Back the Darkness
As noted earlier, at the start of each turn, the Hero that has
the Light Source must roll the Hold Back the Darkness test
to prevent the Darkness marker from moving forward on the
Depth Track. This test occurs at the start of every turn (even
during a Fight), and the longer the Adventure goes, the harder
it is to hold the Darkness back.  

### Models Activate in Initiative Order
After the Hold Back the Darkness test is complete, each
model is Activated in order of Initiative, from highest to lowest.
A model’s Initiative can be found in the upper right corner of
their Hero Character Sheet or Enemy Record Sheet.  

During most turns of the game, only Heroes will be on
the board as they explore the map. During a Fight however,
Activations will often be intermixed between Heroes and
Enemies, based on their relative Initiative scores (more on
Enemies and Fights later).  

Heroes that are tied for Initiative may decide
between them who will go first, and this may be
changed from turn to turn.  

### Room Exploration
When the Heroes discover a new Room Map Tile, it has
an Exploration Token placed on it. Exploration Tokens like
this are revealed and resolved during the Room Exploration
step (note that Passage Map Tiles do not have an Exploration
Token as indicated on each Passage Map Card).  

### End of the Turn
After all models have been Activated and any new Rooms
have been explored, anything that occurs at the End of the
Turn happens. If there are multiple effects that trigger at the
End of the Turn, the Heroes may decide what order to do
them in.  

## Hero Activation
When a Hero is Activated, they may Move and then
either Search or make an Attack. Searching may NOT be
done during a Fight (as the Hero is a little busy).  

### Hero Movement
At the start of a Hero’s Activation, the first thing they
should do is to roll a single D6 for Movement. The Hero
may Move a number of spaces up to the amount rolled on
the die.  

Models have no facing and may move forward, back, side
to side, and even diagonally. Models may NOT move through
other models or through Walls, and may only move into valid
spaces on the board (it must be at least 50% of a full space, to
be considered a valid space).  

The two half-spaces of an open-ended puzzle connection
on a Map Tile are considered to be Doorways and models
MAY move into these half-spaces.  

If a Hero rolls a 1 on their Move roll, they
are allowed to Recover one Grit. This is the
main method for Heroes getting Grit during
the game. If a Hero is already at their Max
Grit, they may immediately use the new Grit
on the spot, usually to add an extra D6 to their
Movement.  

Note that using Grit to add an extra D6 to your movement
does not let you Recover another Grit if you roll a 1 on that
D6, as it is simply extra movement, not a Move roll.  

### Map Tile Puzzle Connections
It is important to note that a Hero standing in a puzzle
connection space (between two Map Tiles) counts as being on
both of those Map Tiles. This can be important for Abilities
or effects that target every model on a specific Map Tile.  

### Barriers
Some spaces on the board have one
or more edges with a thick, white line.
These are called Barriers and usually
represent elevation changes or obstacles
that prevent movement but can be seen
through, such as cliffs or low walls.  

Only models that have an ability allowing them to ‘Move
through other models’ may cross these Barrier space edges
during their move. This usually includes models that can fly,,
models that have the ability to leap or climb over obstacles, or
XL-sized Enemies that can smash through them.  

When a Barrier extends slightly beyond the cross point
of multiple spaces, it prevents normal diagonal movement that
would cross this extended end of the Barrier as well.  

Barriers have NO EFFECT on Line of Sight for Ranged
Attacks, adjacency for Escape tests, or Melee Attacks; they
ONLY affect movement. Barriers do NOT prevent random
directional movement using the Bounce chart.  

If a model that can’t move through Barriers ever finds
itself trapped in an area surrounded by Walls/Barriers, it may
move through a Barrier to get out.  

### Walls Blocking Diagonal Movement
As noted above, models may not move or see through
Walls (the thick black border around every Map Tile).
Sometimes a Wall will extend into a Map Tile, covering over
the grid cross point between spaces.  

Walls like this prevent models from moving diagonally
across that Wall. In addition, because the Wall extends between
these diagonal spaces (covering the cross point of the spaces),
the two spaces are NOT considered to be adjacent to one
another. Walls like this block Line of Sight for Ranged Attacks,
prevent diagonal Melee Attacks across them, and prevent other
things like Fear or requiring Escape tests to move away from
Enemies that are diagonally across the Wall.  

### The Light Source and Voices in the Dark
The light from the Light Source is the only safety from the
shadows. It illuminates the entire Map Tile that the Hero
carrying it is currently on, as well as every adjacent Map
Tile. (Note that this includes every individual space on each of
these Map Tiles, regardless of Walls, Line of Sight, etc).  

Any Hero starting their Activation on a Map Tile that is
not within this light (on the same or adjacent Map Tile as the
Light Source) begins hearing ‘Voices in the Dark’, slowly
driving them mad. That Hero immediately takes D6 Horror
Hits.  

### Searching
There are two different types of Searching a Hero can do at
the end of their Movement, when not in a Fight - Scavenging
or Looking through a Door. Note that you may do either of
these things, not both.  

A Hero may not Search on a Map Tile (Scavenge or Look Through a Door) while there is an unrevealed Exploration
Token on that Tile (more on Exploration Tokens later).  

### Scavenging
Any Hero that ends their Move on a Map
Tile (Room, Passage, or the Entrance) that has
not yet been fully Scavenged may attempt to
search the area for anything of value.  

To Scavenge a Map Tile, roll 3 dice. If any of
the dice roll a 6, you have successfully Scavenged the area and
found something! Place a Scavenged marker on the Map Tile.
Then draw one card from the Scavenge Deck for each 6 that
was rolled. Note - only 1 Scavenged marker is placed, regardless
of how many 6s were rolled.  

As noted before, there is no discard pile for the Scavenge
Deck. Each time a Hero needs to draw one or more Scavenge
cards, shuffle the entire Scavenge Deck to draw the number of
cards needed. Note that the Scavenge Deck is approximately
1/3 good, 1/3 bad, and 1/3 nothing, so Scavenging may not
always end up being a benefit to your Hero (but it’s usually
fun to try).  

Each Map Tile may be Scavenged a number of times,
based on how many Heroes are in the Hero Party, before it is
considered fully Scavenged (and may not be Scavenged again).  

- 1-2 Heroes: 1 Scavenge
- 3-4 Heroes: 2 Scavenge
- 5-6 heroes: 3 Scavenge

### Looking Through a Door
Open-ended puzzle connections on a Map Tile (not
blocked off with an End Cap) are considered to be Doors. A
Hero that ends their Move on one of these open-ended puzzle
connection half-spaces may Search by Looking Through the
Door, seeing into the next Map Tile.  

Draw a Map Card and place the Map Tile shown as the
next piece of the board, connected to the Door that the Hero
is looking through. The green arrow on the card shows the
‘Entrance’ to the new Map Tile that should be connected to
the Door.  

If the new Map Tile cannot be placed because it would
overlap an existing Map Tile, rotate the tile to use one of the
other exits as the Entrance. If the tile still does not fit, discard
it and draw a new Map Card to repeat the same process. If the
second Map Tile also does not fit, this exit is not a valid Door
and should be blocked with an End Cap. Any exit that clearly
cannot fit a Map Tile should not be counted when determining
which exits from the Room are Doors (as described in the
section on Exploration below).  

Whenever a new Map Tile is placed, move
the Hero Party marker one step forward on the
Depth Track, showing their progression deeper
into the unexplored area.  

Any time a Hero Looks Through a Door and places a
new Map Tile, that Hero gains 5 XP for exploring.  

The Hero Party marker will no longer move if it ever
reaches the Darkness Start space of the Depth Track.  

Note that Heroes may not look through Doors while
there are Enemies on the board as Searching cannot be
performed during a Fight.  

### Hero Attacks
During their Activation, after moving, a Hero is allowed
to make one Attack. This is covered later in the section on
Fights.  

## Exploration
Exploration is a big part of Shadows of Brimstone, and
allows the Heroes an element of discovery as they pick their
way through the dark halls and rooms of the unexplored area.  

There are two types of Map Tiles, Passages and Rooms.
Passages are short pathways that simply connect different areas
together. Rooms, on the other hand, often hold Encounters or
Enemies that the Heroes must face.  

Whenever a Room Map Tile is placed, draw an
Exploration Token without looking at it and place
it face down on that Map Tile. Passages do not
contain Exploration Tokens and are labeled as such
on their individual Map Cards.  

Once the Map Tile is placed, the Hero that looked through
the Door will be standing in a puzzle connection space that is
half on each Map Tile. As noted above, a Hero on a puzzle
connection space like this is considered to be on BOTH Map
Tiles. This means that during the Room Exploration step of the
turn (after all Heroes have Activated), this Exploration Token
will be revealed as there will be at least one Hero on the Map
Tile with it.  

### Revealing Exploration Tokens
When an Exploration Token is revealed
(after all Heroes have Activated), flip it over
so that all players can see what has been
discovered! An Exploration Token has three
important pieces of information – Door / Gate
Icons (showing the Number of exits the
Room has), Encounters or Attacks!, and if
there are any Clues for the Heroes’ current
Mission. There are also Exploration Tokens
that draw a Darkness card (more on Darkness
later) or have the Heroes roll a Depth Event.  

### Door/Gate Icons
At the top of the Exploration Token you
will find one or more Door Icons {Door}. Each Icon
represents an exit from the Room. So if there
are 2 Door Icons on the Token, there will be 2
Random puzzle connection ‘Doors’ left open on
the Room. On the Map Card for the Room, each
potential exit is marked with a set of numbers to
help randomly determine where the Doors are to be left open.
For each Door Icon, roll a die and consult the Map Card
to determine where that Door will be (roll again if there is
already a Door there). Each puzzle connection exit that is not
a Door should be closed off using an End Cap piece.  

Additional rules for Gates {Gate} are covered in a later section.  

### Encounters and Attack!
Exploration Tokens will always lead to Encounters or an
Attack, both of which are covered a little later on.  

### Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens
The Exploration Token with Darkness
on it requires the Heroes to draw a Darkness
card, while the Token with a Depth Event has
the Heroes roll a D6 and trigger the Depth
Event that corresponds to the number rolled.  

### Clue Icons
Many of the Exploration Tokens have Clue Icons {C}
on them, representing important bits of information
that help the Heroes on their Mission. Clue Icons have
different meanings based on the particular Mission being
played, as described in the Mission entry of the Adventure
Book (some Missions do not use Clue Icons at all).  

### Finding the Objective
When the final Clue Icon needed is found (or whatever
the particular Mission calls for is discovered), the Heroes have
found their Objective!  

This usually means that the Heroes ignore any Door Icons
and Encounters/Attacks on the final Exploration Token (Note
that the Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens still
trigger the Darkness/Depth Event). Instead, the Heroes have
reached their goal and must face a final fight with a larger or
meaner group of Enemies. In the Advanced Game, this comes
in the form of an Epic Threat boss fight. In the introductory
Mission, ‘Scouting Party’, it means fighting a higher level Threat
card of Enemies than normal.  

## Visual Description of Map Tiles
The physical Map Tile components are described in this section so they may assist an AI in understanding and tracking how they are physically placed on the table. Using a shorthand text description to describe a particular Map Tile may even help an AI be able to track where models are placed within the squares of the tile during a Fight so as to assist in playing the game.  

The Map Tiles that are included in various Core, Adventure, and Expansion boxes are flat cardboard tiles that take on various 2D shapes and have artwork depicted on both sides of the 2D tile. The different art work on either side of a particular Map Tile correspond to two different World Locations (e.g., one side might be a tile for the Mines, while the other depicts a location in the Swampsof Jargono).

The edges of the map tiles are black bordered walls and almost every Map Tile has at least two puzzle-cut spaces for connecting to other randomly drawn Map Tiles. Entrance Map Tiles and End Caps only have a single puzzle-cut connector space. 

The artwork depicted on the tile is from a top-down perspective and highly evocative to help visually represent the Heroes walking through the location when the Hero miniatures are placed on the tile. The artwork is split up into a square grid, about 1" square, to regulate miniature movement across the tile. Each square on the Map Tile is called a space.  

Some of the black bordered walls and edges of the map tile will bleed into some of the edges on the Map Tile, creates spaces that are partially filled with artwork depicting the location and partially depicting the black bordered wall. Spaces with at least 50% of the square covered by artwork is still considered a valid space for models to occupy.  

Spaces occupied by puzzle-cut edges are also considered valid spaces and may be occupied by models wither there is another Map Tile connected or not. Every puzzle-cut connection on ever Map Tile in Shadows of Brimstone is two spaces wide to ensure that all Map Tiles can be connected to one another.  

## Winning and Losing
To Win a Mission, the Heroes must find the Objective and
defeat any Enemies guarding it, as detailed in the particular
Mission being played. For the basic ‘Scouting Party’ Mission,
the Heroes simply need to find the Objective room at the
second Clue Icon and defeat the Enemies there.  

There are two main ways for the Heroes to Fail any
Mission - if all of the Heroes are KO’d or if the Darkness
Escapes.  

### All Heroes KO'd
If all of the Heroes are ever KO’d at the same time,
the Mission immediately ends in failure. The Heroes are
considered to escape, but must all still roll for Injury/Madness.  

### Darkness Escapes
If the Darkness marker ever reaches the Entrance space on
the Depth Track, the Darkness escapes and lays waste to the
countryside. The Mission is failed and the Heroes must head
home in defeat.  

### Running Away
Sometimes things look pretty grim. If all of the Heroes
agree (at least all those that are not yet KO’d), at the start of
any turn, the Hero Party may elect to Flee from the Adventure!
This must be done before anything else in the turn happens.
All of the Heroes (including those that are KO’d) escape and
the Mission is considered to have been failed. Any Heroes that
were KO’d still need to roll for Injury/Madness.  

## Darkness and the Growing Dread
### Darkness Cards
Darkness cards are evil events that can cause Enemies to
leap from the shadows, ceilings to collapse, supernatural events
to occur, or allow the Darkness to steadily grow in power with
cards that Remain in Play. Darkness cards are pretty much
always bad for the Heroes.  

There are two main ways for Darkness cards to be drawn
during the game, whenever the Darkness marker reaches a
Blood Spatter space on the Depth Track, and whenever a
card’s game text instructs the players to do so (this is usually
caused by Scavenge or Encounter cards).  

When a Darkness card is drawn, it is read aloud to all
players, starting with the card title, and then its game effect is
resolved. Once complete, the card is discarded (unless it is
marked as Remains in Play at the bottom of the card).  
### Growing Dread Cards
Growing Dread cards are dark and powerful events that
can spell doom for the Heroes. Unlike Darkness cards, they
are usually not played immediately when drawn. Instead,
whenever a Growing Dread card is drawn, it is placed face
down, without looking at it, in a stack near the Depth Track.
Growing Dread cards are always added to the top of the stack,
and can be fanned out a little so that players can see how many
cards are in the stack. In this way, it creates an impending
feeling of doom over the course of the game as more cards get
added to the stack, with each being potentially deadly!  
### Resolving Growing Dread
When the Objective is found for the current Mission, but
before any Threat cards are drawn or Enemies placed, the
cards in the Growing Dread stack are revealed and resolved,
one at a time, starting from the top of the stack. For the
remainder of this Objective, if any new Growing Dread cards
would be added to the stack, instead resolve them immediately.  
### Canceling Growing Dread
The Heroes are not helpless though. A Growing Dread
card may be canceled if all of the Heroes in the Party collectively
use 1 Grit each (not including Heroes that are KO’d). This
may be done while a Growing Dread card is still face down
(cancel the top card of the stack), or once it has been revealed
(before it takes effect).  

## Health, Sanity and Corruption
There are many ways that a Hero can get hurt while fighting their way through an Adventure (or even just while walking
through the demon-infested wilderness). Every Hero has Health, that measures their ability to take physical damage before
being knocked out, and Sanity, that covers their ability to take mental strain before going mad. It is also possible to be corrupted
by dark influences and even start to mutate from it.  

### Types of Hits
There are 3 types of Hits that a Hero can take - Hits,
Horror Hits, and Corruption Hits.  

- Hits: Hits represent physical damage and cause Wounds if not
prevented.
- Horror Hits: Horror Hits represent mental strain and cause Sanity
Damage if not prevented.
- Corruption Hits: Corruption Hits represent dark influence and cause
Corruption Points if not prevented.

### Defense and Willpower
Each Hero has Defense and Willpower marked on their
character sheets. Both of these are saving rolls that allow the
Hero to try and prevent incoming Hits from doing damage.
Defense is used to prevent Hits while Willpower is used to
prevent both Horror Hits and Corruption Hits.  

Anytime a Hero takes one or more Hits, they may make
a Defense roll against each, needing to roll equal to or higher
than their Defense value to prevent the Hit. For example, if
a Hero has a Defense of 4+ and takes 3 Hits, they would roll
3 Defense dice with each roll of 4, 5, or 6 preventing one of
the incoming Hits. For each Defense roll that failed, the Hero
would take damage from that Hit.  

Willpower works exactly the same way, but is used for
incoming Horror Hits and Corruption Hits instead.  

### Types of Damage
**Wounds**  
Wound markers are placed on a Hero’s
Character Sheet (or Enemy) to show that they
have taken damage against their Health. Each
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Wound unless
stated otherwise.  

**Sanity Damage**  
anity Damage markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to show that they
have taken damage against their Sanity. Each
Horror Hit that is not prevented does 1 Sanity
Damage unless stated otherwise.  

**Corrupton Points**  
Corruption Point markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to track how much
Corruption they have gained. Each Corruption
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Corruption Point.  

### Cover
Sometimes a model will have a special Cover save allowing
them to try and block each incoming Hit they are about to
take. Cover saves work similar to a Defense roll (stopping
an entire Hit when successfully rolled), but are made before
Defense rolls. In addition, a model with a Cover save may still
roll for it, even if the Hit ignores its Defense.  

### Shields
A Shield is an Item that a Hero may carry allowing them
to block some amount of incoming Damage (as listed on the
Item). A Shield must be equipped to be used and usually takes
one of the Hero’s Hand Slots.  

A Shield may be used to prevent Damage
after any Cover and Defense rolls are made, but
must be used before any Armor rolls are made.  

### Amor and Spirit Armor
Armor helps to protect a Hero, even
after their Defense or Willpower has failed
them. Armor protects against Wounds
while Spirit Armor protects against Sanity
Damage. Neither one helps against
Corruption though.  

If a Hero has an Item or ability that
gives them Armor, whenever they are
about to take a number of Wounds (after
Defense rolls and any use of a Shield), roll a D6 for
each individual Wound they are about to take. For each die
roll that is equal to or better than their Armor save, that Wound
is prevented. For example, if a Hero has Armor 5+ and takes two
Hits past their Defense that do 3 Wounds each, the Hero rolls 6 dice.
For every 5 or 6 rolled, one of the incoming Wounds is prevented.  

Spirit Armor works the same way, but allows the Hero to
roll of each point of incoming Sanity Damage instead.  

A Hero may not apply more than one Armor save at a
time (from different Items/abilities), but only uses the best
Armor save they currently have equipped.  

Some Enemies can also have Armor as an ability. This
works just like a Hero’s Armor.  

### Being KO'd
If a Hero ever has Wounds equal to their
Health or Sanity Damage equal to their Sanity,
they are immediately KO’d (Knocked Out),
and no more Wounds/Sanity Damage will be
applied (you cannot fall below 0). Remove
the Hero model from the board and place
a KO’d Hero marker in their space. Other
models may freely move into and through a
space with a KO’d Hero.  

### Recovering
At the end of any turn when there are no Enemies
anywhere on the board, a KO’d Hero may Recover. That
Hero places their model back on the board, removing the
KO’d Hero marker and pushing any model that was in their
space to an adjacent space. They then roll once on the Injury
Chart if their Health was reduced to 0 or the Madness Chart
if their Sanity was reduced to 0. They also get to Heal 2D6
Wounds/Sanity (any mix). This Healing must bring their
Health and Sanity back to at least 1 each.  

If a Hero was reduced to 0 in both Health and Sanity at
the same time, they must roll once on each Chart, but then get
to Heal 2D6 Health and 2D6 Sanity.  

### Revive Tokens
Revive Tokens are a special bonus that
allow the Heroes to overcome otherwise dire
situations. Usually Revive Tokens are held by
the entire Party as a whole rather than by an
individual Hero. Whenever a Hero would be
KO’d, if there are one or more Revive Tokens available, that
Hero may discard a Revive Token to instead be immediately
restored to Full Health and Full Sanity, and Recover 1 Grit.
The Hero does NOT need to roll for Injury or Madness when
using a Revive Token, and ignores any remaining incoming
Hits or Damage from the source that would have KO’d them.  

## Healing

### Healing Health and Sanity
Whenever a Hero is allowed to Heal Health or Sanity
Damage, they simply remove that number of damage markers
from their character. When a Hero is allowed to Fully Heal
Wounds or Sanity Damage, they get to remove all damage
markers of that type from their character.  

### Healing Other Heroes
Any time a Hero Heals Wounds or Sanity Damage from
another Hero (regardless of the method), they gain 5 XP for
each Wound/Sanity healed.  

Tokens like Rum and Bandages may be used to Heal other
Heroes that are adjacent to you during a Fight, or even just on
the same Map Tile while there are no Enemies on the board.  

### Corrupton and Mutation
Fighting nightmarish creatures and working around Dark
Stone can be hazardous, not just to your health and sanity,
but to your soul! As Heroes gain Corruption Points, they
will begin to mutate and change over time. A Hero’s ability to
withstand these effects is called their Corruption Resistance.  

### Corruption Resistance Value
Every Hero starts with a default Corruption Resistance
value of 5. This means that a Hero may only ‘hold’ up to 4
Corruption Points at a time without any ill effect. As soon as
the Hero has 5 Corruption Points (Corruption equal to their
Corruption Resistance value), those Corruption are removed
and the Hero must immediately roll once on the Mutation
chart.  

A Hero’s Corruption Resistance value may be modified by
Items they acquire, events they encounter on their Adventures,
and any number of other things in the game, causing that
Hero to be able to ‘hold’ more or fewer Corruption Points
before they mutate.  

### Rolling For Mutation
To roll on the Mutation chart, a Hero must roll a ‘D36’.
To roll a D36, roll two dice of different colors, where one
of them is the ‘10’s digit and the other is the ‘1’s digit. For
Example, if your rolled 3 and 5 the result on the chart would
be 35.  

### Mutation Death
If a Hero ever rolls a Mutation on the chart that they already
currently have, they have instead mutated beyond recognition
and have become little more than a writhing mass of tentacles
and goo. That Hero is considered to be Dead (though they
may still be Resurrected in Camp between Adventures).  

## A Random Hero
There are many things in the game that require you to
determine a Random Hero. There are two simple ways to do
this - use the Hero Tokens provided to draw one
randomly, or simply roll a die.  
A Hero Token for each Hero in this Set
has been provided and these can be used to
draw from without looking to determine a
Random Hero.  
Alternatively, it is often faster and easier
to simply point to the different Heroes or Players and assign
each a number set, then roll a die to see which is selected.
For instance, if there are 3 Heroes you could say Hero A is
1-2, Hero B is 3-4, and Hero C is 5-6, then roll a D6. Keep
in mind that the D8 also works great for this if there are 4
Heroes (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8).  

## Encounters and Skill Tests
Often times Heroes will come across aspects of the environment or situations that they need to try to overcome or deal with
using their Skills. These are called Encounters and are most often found as part of an Exploration Token while investigating a
room. Encounters can range from a blazing fire to a ghostly apparition, or anything in between.  

### Hero Skills
Every Hero has a set of six Skills that they use to interact
with Encounters, overcome dangerous challenges, and that
define the Hero’s mental and physical prowess.  
A Hero’s Skill values range from 1 to 6. Each of these
values may never be modified to go below 1 or above 6.  

**Agility**  
Used for running, jumping, diving, and rolling, Agility is
tested for challenges that require physical dexterity and stealth.  
**Cunning**  
The ability to understand technology, to outwit opponents,
and to solve puzzles, Cunning is used for challenges that
require the Hero to think their way past a problem.  
**Spirit**  
Used for interacting with the supernatural and the Void,
Spirit determines how good the Hero is at overcoming
demonic and ghostly Encounters as well as mental fortitude.  
**Strength**  
Physical brawn and brute force, Strength determines how
good the Hero is at overpowering things and influences how
far they can throw an item or how much weight they can carry.  
**Lore**  
Knowledge of myth and legend, Lore determines a Hero’s
ability to decipher ancient languages and riddles as well as to
tell stories and interact with occult elements.  
**Luck**  
One cannot underestimate the power of being lucky. Of
course, this has just as much to do with a Hero’s ability to
minimize the effects of bad luck while capitalizing on any
good fortune that comes their way.  

### Encounters
When the Heroes find an Exploration Token that says
Encounter on it, they must draw a card from the Encounter
Deck to see what they have found. Encounters are situations that the Heroes must overcome
to continue on their Mission.
Usually Encounters will have
one or more Skill tests that the
Heroes need to perform.  
Encounters affect all
Heroes, not just those that are
currently in the same room
(though some Encounters
are listed specifically as only
affecting Heroes that are on
the Map Tile). Heroes that are
currently in another World
do NOT participate.  
### Who Takes the Test
Skill tests on an Encounter are
marked with an icon to show who must take the test.  
- {One Hero} One Hero: One Hero is chosen to make the
Skill test. The Heroes must decide amongst
themselves who will take it.
- {All Heroes} All Heroes: Every Hero must make the Skill test.
- {One Random} One Random: One Hero, chosen randomly,
must make the Skill test.

### Making a Skill Test
To make a Skill test, the Hero rolls a number of dice
equal to their value in that Skill. As long as any one of those
dice is equal to or greater than the target number, the test is
successfully passed.  
For example, if a Hero needs to make a Lore 5+ test, they roll
a number of dice equal to their Lore Skill. As long as one of those
dice rolls a 5 or higher, the test is passed. If not, the test is failed.  

### Skill Tests Outside of an Encounter
Sometimes Heroes will be called on to make a Skill test
outside of an Encounter. This most often occurs because of
special Enemy abilities or between Adventures while in Camp.
These Skill tests work the same way, and it should be clear by
the Event or card text who needs to make the test (usually the
Hero that rolled the Event).  

### Multiple Encounters
Sometimes an Exploration Token will call for multiple
Encounters (For Example - Encounters x2). When this occurs,
draw all of the needed Encounters and resolve them in any
order you like. The only important thing to note is that any
Enemies that Attack as a result of an Encounter will not be
placed or start the Fight until all of the other non-Enemy
aspects of the Encounters have been completed (so all Skill
tests, etc. must be taken before Enemies are placed on the
board). This can result in multiple Enemy Attacks at once.  


## XP and Gold
XP and Gold are only needed when keeping Heroes
from one Adventure to the next, and are gathered in large
quantities, so no counters are included for them. Instead, it is
recommended that players track their XP and Gold by keeping
a running total of each on a piece of paper.  

## Cards
There are many different decks of cards in the game that
are used for everything from dynamically generating the board
as you explore it, to the Enemies you encounter, to the cool
Gear and Artifacts you find along the way.  

**Keywords**  
Most cards have Keywords associated with them, listed
just below the title of the card. The Keywords usually do not
have any inherent meaning, but are occasionally referenced by
other cards and rules.  

**Icons**  
Many cards contain icons that represent various aspects
of the card. A full list of these icons can be found on the
Reference Summary at the back of this Rulebook.  

**Remains in Play**  
Some cards are listed as Remains in Play. As it sounds,
these cards stay in play and continue to affect the game until
the end of the Adventure, or they are canceled in some way.  

**Discard Piles**  
For each deck of cards in the game there will also be a
discard pile. The discard pile should be formed face up next to
the deck and is where cards from that deck go when they have
been used and are no longer in play. Any player may look
through any discard pile at any time. If any deck ever runs
out of cards, shuffle the discard pile thoroughly and reform the
deck face down.  

Some of the card decks (such as Loot and Scavenge cards)
do not have discard piles, but rather are fully shuffled every
time one or more cards need to be drawn.  

## Card Types

### Gear and Artifact Cards
Gear and Artifact cards represent different items and pieces of equipment that a Hero can collect and use to help them on
their adventures. Gear are more common items that can be found and are often a bit more disposable. Artifacts are more rare
and powerful items that usually have occult or magical origins, or come from another world altogether.  

### Items
There are a few limiting factors that restrict how many
Items that a Hero may carry and use at any given time.  
**Hands**  
Each Hero has 2 Hand slots that they can assign Items
to each turn. This can be up to two different Single-Handed
Items or one Double-Handed Item.  
- {Single Handed} Single Handed: This Item requires one of the Hero's two Hand slots to have equipped during the turn.
- {Double Handed} Double Handed: This Item requires both of the Hero’s Hand slots
to have equipped during the turn.

At the start of a Hero’s Activation each turn, the Hero
may decide what Items they want to assign to their two Hand
slots. Any of the Hero’s other unassigned Items that require
one or two Hands to use, do not give the Hero any benefit
from their card text.  
Note that assigning Items to your Hand slots ‘at the start
of your Activation’ is usually only important during a Fight
and it is assumed that the Hero can swap different Items into
and out of their Hands when there are no Enemies on the
board. You may still only ever use two Hand slots at any given
time though.  

**Weight and Caryying Limit**  
Many Items have one or more small Weight
icons {Anvil} on them to show that they are limited.  
Hero may only carry 5 + their Strength
in Weight icons {Anvil} at any time.  

**Keyword Restrictions**  
Some Items have a red restriction bar that requires a Hero
to have a certain Keyword to be able to use the Item. For
example, if an Item says Strange Only, the Hero must have
the Keyword Strange to use the Item.  

**Clothing Items**  
Occasionally an Item will have the
Keyword Clothing followed by one
or more other Keywords that tell the
Clothing Slot that the Item fills (Torso,
Shoulders, Gloves, Coat, etc). These
Items can be very powerful, but a Hero
is limited to only a single Clothing
Item for each unique Clothing Slot. So
a Hero may only have one Clothing
- Gloves equipped at any given time,
as well as one Clothing - Coat and
one Clothing - Hat, etc.  

**Items with Limited Use**  
Some Items are limited in how often they can be used.
These Items are marked as ‘Once Per Turn’, ‘Once Per Fight’,
‘Once Per Adventure’, etc. When a Limited Use Item like this
is used, rotate the card or flip the card over to Exhaust it
(show that it has been used). You may Ready that card (unrotate
or flip it back over to show that it may be used again)
when the time frame of its limitation is complete.  
So for instance, a ‘Once Per Turn’ Item should be
Exhausted when used, and then be Readied at the end of the
current Turn, while a ‘Once Per Fight’ Item would be Readied
at the end of the current Fight.  
This terminology is also used for some Abilities.  

### Personal Items
Personal Items are very powerful and characterful cards
that are unique. Every new Hero character gets to draw
one Personal Item to give them a special bonus as well as
to thematically help fill in the backstory of the character. If
a Duelist gets the War Veteran’s Dagger, perhaps she has seen
death up close during the wars in Europe! Or perhaps she
took it as a trophy from the first opponent she ever defeated
in a duel.  
Personal Items may never be traded, lost, sold, or
discarded in any way. They help to define who the Hero is
and the Hero will carry it till the day they die.  

### Dark Stone Icons
{Dark Stone} Some Items have a Dark Stone Icon on them,
usually in the upper left corner. This means that
the Item is charged with Dark Stone energy in
some way and counts as one Dark Stone when
considering how much Dark Stone a Hero is carrying.  

### Item Upgrades
Many Items have the capacity to be upgraded to give
them extra benefits or abilities. These Items have one or more
Upgrade Slots on them, shown at the bottom left of the card.  

**Upgrade Slots**  
{Upgrade Slot}  
{Upgrade Required Slot}  
Items often have up to 3 Upgrade Slots
on it, with each Slot represented as an empty
circle. Upgrade Slots can be filled with an
Upgrade Item or with a Forged Dark Stone Upgrade added
to the Item by a blacksmith in Camp. These Upgrades will
have one or more Slot Requirements (filled in black circles)
to show how many Upgrade Slots they occupy
when attached to an Item.  

**Attaching an Upgrade**  
As noted above, Upgrades come in two forms, either as
a card that the Hero finds during an Adventure, or as Dark
Stone that is forged directly onto the Item in Town.  
An Upgrade card lists on it what it can be attached to as
well as if it takes any resources to attach it to an Item (usually
Dark Stone).  
When an Upgrade card is
attached to an Item, it fills in a
number of Upgrade Slots equal to
its Slot Requirement and gives that
Item the listed Bonus.  
Upgrade cards attached to an
Item can be removed at any time
so that they can be attached to
a different Item, sold, etc. The
resources used to attach the
Upgrade originally are lost.  
Dark Stone that is Forged
directly onto an Item
is a permanent change and may
not be removed. It is now part
of the Item.  

### Side Bag
Each Hero has a Side
Bag that is used to carry
helpful Side Bag Tokens
like Rum, Bandages,
Bomb, Tonic, etc. A Side
Bag may hold up to 5
Tokens on it at a time
and these can be any
mixture of different Side
Bag Tokens.  

**Side Bag Tokens**  
Side Bag Tokens are generally small ‘discard to
use’ objects that a Hero may have more than one of. A Side
Bag Token can be identified by its parchment background and
green title bar for the name of the Token.  
Generally, Side Bag Tokens may be used at any time
(unless used as an Attack/Free Attack, which must be during
your Activation).  
A complete reference of all Side Bag Tokens is found later in this reference.  
## Creating A New Hero
Creating a new Hero is fast and easy. It is often just as fun
to start a fresh new Hero as it is to keep one Hero from game
to game, over a series of Adventures. To create a new Hero,
just follow these simple steps:  

### Choose Hero Class (and Sub-Class)
The most important choice for a new Hero is what
Hero Class you want to play, and for a Team Hero like the
Conquistadors, Vikings, or Trederran Strike Team, what Sub-Class you want to play.  
Each Hero Class/Sub-Class has its own unique stats and Abilities,
and a fairly different play style.  
Most standard Hero Classes have no Sub-Class. But Adventure Sets use Team Heroes. In the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set, 
the Heroes are the Conquistador Hero Class, but there are 4
different Sub-Classes of Conquistador to choose from - El
Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier.  

### Get Starting Items
Every Hero Class/Sub-Class has a small list of Starting
Items printed on their Character Sheet that they get for free.
Find these Items for your Hero amongst the Starting Gear
cards. It is important to note that, in many ways, the Starting
Gear of a Hero is just as important a factor as their Abilities
and stats. Note that Heroes may NOT trade or give their
Starting Items to other Heroes.  

### Draw a Personal Item
Every Hero starts their adventuring career with one
Personal Item that not only gives them a powerful bonus,
but can help to define the backstory of that Hero. Draw one
Personal Item card for your Hero.  
Some Hero Classes draw from special themed decks of Personal Item Cards. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not specify a specific deck to draw your Personal Item card from, use the standard deck.

### Choose Your Starting Upgrade
When creating a brand new Hero you get to choose one of
the Hero Starting Upgrades available to your Hero Class. Each
Sub-Class of Conquistador has 2 unique Starting Upgrades
to choose from that help to define your Hero right from the
beginning. Choose wisely though as the Upgrade you don’t
pick will not be available later.  

### Get a Side Bag and Free Token
Take a Side Bag
marker for your Hero.
Every Hero has a Side
Bag that can hold up
to 5 Tokens in it. A
New Hero also gets
to choose one Side Bag
Token to start with for free.
Choose from Rum, Bandages, Tonic,
or Bomb.  

As new Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been released over the years, Heroes that were included in different sets are inteded to pick from a different pool of Side Bag Tokens for their free starting token. Heroes native to different settings and sets should pick from the starting tokens provided in the following table:  

- **Old West Heroes:**
(City of Ancients Core Set, Swamps of Death Core Set, The Impossible Hell Train Core Set, Various Hero Packs)  
  - Bandage
  - Whiskey
  - Tonic 
  - Dynamite

- **Feudal Japanese Heroes:**
(Forbidden Fortress Core Set, Various Hero Packs)
  - Bandage
  - Sake
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Spanish Fort Heroes:**
(Valley of the Serpent King Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - Rum
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Viking Heroes:**
(Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - ?
  - Tonic
  - ?

- **Trederran Team Heroes:**
(Trederran Strike Team Expansion)
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?

Some specific Heroes, such as a the Jargono Native, may have special rules which allow that Hero to start with a different Side Bag token. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not have specify any special tokens, use the previous tables to pick according to the native setting of your Hero's Class/Sub-Class.  

### Name Your Hero
Lastly, you should choose a
fitting name for your Hero. And pick
something good, you never know if that
name will be spoken of as legend in the
royal courts throughout Spain and the world
at large!  

## Adventure Set Up
An Adventure is generally a single play-session where the Heroes try to successfully complete a Mission. While players can choose to play a Campaign, keeping their Heroes across many Adventures and play-sessions, Shadows of Brimstone can also be played as just a single Adventure if players choose.  

To Set Up for an Adventure, complete the following steps in the order listed.  

### Number of Players/Heroes
Decide on the number of Heroes that will be taking part
in the Adventure. Usually this is one Hero per player, but
sometimes it is fun to play a game controlling two or more
Heroes each, for a fewer number of players.  

### Shuffle Card Decks
Thoroughly shuffle all of the required card decks and place them on the table. Most Adventures require the following decks of cards:  
- Darkness
- Growing Dread
- Loot
- Scavenge
- Low, Med, High, and Epic Threats
- Gear
- Artifacts
- Encounters
- Map Cards
- World Card

If playing an Adventure in an OtherWorld, you will need the Threat, Encounters, Map Cards, and Artifacts corresponding to that OtherWorld.  

Note that players may freely mix cards and other content across multiple Core Sets, Adventure Sets, and other expansions as they desire. For example, if playing an Adventure in the Forbidden Fortress as Fedual Japanese Heroes, the players may wish to only include Darkness, Growing Dread, Gear, and Threat cards intended for the Forbidden Fortress setting. Or, they may wish to include cards from any other content as desired!

For Loot and Scavenge decks, players are free to combine cards across multiple Core and Adventure Sets, but doing so is not recommended. The distribution of cards in these two decks provide a mix of good, neutral, and bad effects as intended by the designers.  

Don't forget to place an appropriate World Card face up on the table that matches the World in which your Adventure is taking place, as it may add special gameplay effects as depicted on the card.  

During your Adventures, you
may pass through Gates that allow you to visit strange
alien OtherWorlds. These Worlds each have their own World
card. Some Missions actually begin in an OtherWorld, as
listed in the Mission Set Up.  

### Prepare Exploration Tokens
Shuffle up all 8 Exploration Tokens and create a stack of
them face down that players can draw from when they find a
new room.  

Mixing Exploration Tokens from multiple Core and Adventure Sets is not recommended.

### Ready Heroes
Prepare each Hero that will be taking part. If these are
new Heroes, make sure each of them is ready to go using the
steps of Creating a New Hero.  

One Hero gets the Old Lantern card as the Light Source,
in addition to their other Gear. The players may choose who
will take it at the start of each Adventure.  

Draw Team Ability cards and add them to the pool if any players are using Team Heroes. 

Ensure each Hero has any necessary starting markers, tokens, etc., such as Grit, Ability Tokens (Ambition, Fury, Mana, etc.), free Side Bag Token, etc. 

### Select Mission
Select a Mission to play. For your first time learning the game, this should
be the first Basic Mission included in the Core Set or Adventure Set you are playing with.  

Players may use whatever methods the like to select a Mission. They may pick one by choice, select one randomly, or use whatever methodology they like.  

Note that some Missions have special Set Up instructions.  

### Prepare Depth Track
Place the Depth Track where all players can see it, and
position the Darkness marker on the Darkness Start space and
the Hero Party marker on the Entrance space. Note that some Missions may have special instructions which may modify these rules.  

### Place Entrance Map Tile
Set the Entrance Map Tile in the center of the table,
where all players can reach it.  

### Place Heroes
Lastly, each Hero model is placed on the Entrance Map
Tile in one of the 8 Starting Area spaces.  

The Starting Area on the Entrance Map Tile includes all
8 spaces in the back two rows. The
Heroes can be positioned in any of these eight spaces, and
should be placed on the board in Initiative order, from highest
to lowest.  

## Number of Heroes
The number of Heroes taking part in an Adventure
determines the difficulty and quantity of Enemies you will
be facing. This is scaled in two ways - with Low, Med,
and High Threat Decks for Enemies as well as with Revive
Tokens to help fewer Heroes survive a little longer.  

| Heroes | Scaling |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | Low Threats, 2 Revive Tokens |
| 2      | Low Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 3      | Med Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 4      | Med Threats |
| 5      | High Treats, 1 Revive Token |
| 6      | High Treats |

## Enemies
Every Enemy Type is represented by a large Enemy Record Sheet that lists its stats and abilities. The Record Sheets are
double-sided and have the normal (green) stats on one side, and the Brutal (red) stats on the other. The Brutal Enemy side is
generally only used for groups of Heroes that are quite experienced and have been through many Adventures.  

### Enemy Type
This tells the name of the specific Enemy Type, such as
Tentacles, Temple Guard, or Drowned Dead.  

### Keyword
All Enemies have one or more Keywords that define the
category they fall into (Demon, Myth, Void, etc). Generally
these Keywords don’t have any built-in meaning, but are often
referenced by other cards or abilities.  

### Size
The Size of the Enemy - Small, Medium, Large, Extra
Large, or even XXL.  

### Initiative
Just like Heroes, every Enemy has an Initiative that tells
when they get to Activate in the turn order.  

### Abilities
Most Enemies have one or more Special Abilities that
affect how they fight the Heroes.  

### Move
This is the number of spaces that the Enemy can move
during their Activation. Unlike Heroes, Enemies have a fixed
move which makes them predictable and easier to move in
large groups.  

### Escape
When a Hero is adjacent to the Enemy and wants to move
away, they must first pass an Escape test using this Escape
value (more on this a bit later).  

### 'To Hit' Values
Just like Heroes, Enemies have a To Hit value for Ranged
Attacks and Melee Attacks.  

### Combat
The number of Combat dice the Enemy gets to roll against
a Hero when making a Melee Attack.  

### Damage
The amount of Damage a Hero takes for each Enemy
Combat Hit they fail to block with their Defense.  

### Defense
Unlike a Hero’s Defense (which is a roll to block
Damage), an Enemy’s Defense is a fixed amount of Damage
that is prevented from each Hit the Enemy would take.  

### Health
The number of Wounds that it takes to kill the Enemy.  

### XP Value
Every Enemy is worth XP to the Hero that kills it.
Many larger or tougher Enemies give XP to a Hero just for
Wounding it.  

### Elite Chart
Every Enemy Type has an Elite Chart of six extra Abilities
that make it harder to defeat or more deadly in a Fight. When
a group of Enemies is Elite, they get to roll on the Chart to
see what extra Ability or Abilities that group of Enemies has.  

### Brutal Side
Brutal Enemy Side
The back side of each Enemy Record Sheet has the Brutal
version of that Enemy Type, displayed with a red background.
These Brutal Enemies are generally only encountered by higher
level Heroes that have played many Adventures. This is a way
of scaling the Enemies that the Heroes have to fight over the
course of a campaign.  

## Fights
When the Heroes come across a group of Enemies, their exploration of the area takes a back seat to fighting for their lives.
These engagements are called Fights and cover the time from when Enemies appear until the last Enemy is defeated and the
Fight is over. Fights make up the bulk of the action in the game and are an exciting way for the Heroes to get XP and Loot,
though they can also be quite dangerous.  

### Attack!
The most common way for a Fight to
begin is by finding an Attack Exploration
Token while Exploring a Room. When
an Attack occurs, the Heroes must draw a
Threat card to see what has attacked them.
Attacks can also be caused by other things
as well, such as Darkness cards, Encounters, a
Depth Event, etc.  

### Drawing Threat Cards
When a Fight begins,
the first thing that the
players need to do is find
out what Enemies are
actually attacking them.
Usually, this means drawing
a Threat card (though
sometimes the Attack will
call for a specific Type of
Enemy as listed on the card
or Event that caused the
Attack in the first place).  
To draw a Threat card,
you simply take the top card
from the Threat Deck of the
appropriate Threat Level. This
is based on the number of Heroes in the Party.
1-2 Heroes use the Low Threats (green), 3-4 Heroes use the
Med Threats (yellow), and 5-6 Heroes use the High Threats
(red).  

### Attacks by Specific Enemies
When a card or event calls for an Attack by a specific
Enemy Type, there is no need to draw a Threat card. Instead,
the Type and number of Enemies is pre-set and listed in the
text for that card/event.  

### Number of Enemy Models
Sometimes the number of Enemy
models that will be taking part in the Fight
is simply listed on the card. Many times,
however, it will be a variable number of
Enemies that the players must roll for, using
a D6, D3, or the Peril Die {P}.  
The Peril Die is a special 6-sided die that has
faces marked 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, and 6. This allows for a
variable number of Enemies to show up, but never
less than 3 at a time.  
The Peril die is represented on cards and text as
the symbol: {P}  
Sometimes multiple Peril Dice will be used to find
the number of Enemies for an Enemy Type that favors
larger groups. For instance, Tentacles often show up with
up to 12 Enemies at a time, and will frequently be listed
on a Threat card as:  
{P}{P} Tentacles  
In these cases, the Peril Die should be rolled twice and the
two numbers added together to find the total.  

### Placing Enemies on the Board
Once you have determined what Types of Enemies are
taking part in the Fight, and how many there are of each
Type, it is time to place them on the board. Enemies from an
Attack Exploration Token are placed on the Map Tile where
the Token was revealed.  
Enemies are placed on the board in reverse
order of Initiative, from lowest to highest. So
the slowest Enemies are always at the back of
the group.  
Starting with the lowest Initiative Enemy Type, models
are placed on the Map Tile in every other space, forming a
checkerboard pattern starting in the row farthest from the Map
Tile Entrance, all the way to the back left (as shown in the
diagram below). This includes any puzzle connection halfspaces.  
Once all of an Enemy Type has been placed, continue
on to the next lowest Initiative Enemy Type, until all Enemies
have been placed on the board. If more than one Enemy
Type shares the same Initiative, roll randomly between them
for which is placed first.  
Skip over any spaces that are not valid map spaces (less
than 50% of a space) as well as any spaces that already have
a model in it.  

### Placing Enemy Example
Since this is a text only example with no visual diagrams, let's imagine a Map Tile on the table with each space number and display as below as columns and rows:  
```
      |01|02|  
      |03|04|05|06|  
|07|08|09|10|11|12|  
|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|  
   |20|21|22|23|24|25|  
         |26|27|  
         |28|29|  
```
The Map Tile entrance spaces in the above map would be spaces 28 and 29. 
If you had to play 2 Temple Guard (Initiative 3) and 6 Serpentmen Archers (Initiative 6), the Temple Guard would be placed first, starting on the opposide side of the Map Tile entrance spaces. Once all Enemy models were placed they would be located as follows:
- Temple Guard: 01, 04
- Serpentmen Archers: 06, 07, 09, 11, 14, 16

If there are more Enemy models to place than will fit in
the checkerboard pattern on the Map Tile, return to the back
row and begin placing models to fill in the spaces between.  
If there are more models than will fit on the Map Tile,
even with every space filled (which is rather rare), overflow
models should be placed onto the Map Tile connected to
the Entrance of the Room (most likely filling in around the
Heroes) until they have all been placed.

### Not Enough Models
If you are called on to place more Enemies of a particular
Enemy Type than you have models available (for instance, you
must place 2 Temple Guard, but you only have 1 model as the
rest are already on the board), place all of the models that you
do have available, and ALL Enemies of that Type gain a free
Elite ability for the duration of this Fight.  

### Elite Enemies
Sometimes the Heroes will encounter a particularly nasty
group of Enemies that are stronger, tougher, or more dangerous
than normal. This is represented by Enemies having one or
more Elite abilities.  
When a group of Enemies is Elite, you must roll once on
the Elite Chart at the bottom of the Enemy’s Record Sheet to
see what extra ability they have. This Elite ability is applied to
ALL Enemies of that Type for the duration of the Fight (so if
you have 4 Tentacles on the board and 2 more show up that are
Elite, all Tentacles on the board will get the Elite ability rolled).
You may place a marker or die on the Enemy Record Sheet to
keep track of which Ability they have gained (1-6).  
It is possible, especially as Heroes gain experience and go
up in Hero Level, that a group of Enemies may have more
than one Elite ability (double Elite or even triple Elite, etc).
This just means that you must roll multiple times on the Elite
Chart to see what abilities those Enemies have. If the same
Elite ability is rolled more than once, Re-roll (unless noted
otherwise in the text of that Ability).  
There is a bonus to fighting Elite Enemies, however, in
that Elite Enemies are worth +5 XP for each Elite Ability they
have.  

## Ambush Attacks
Sometimes an Enemy Attack will be listed as an Ambush
Attack. This means that the Enemies have surprised the
Heroes and are able to spring from the shadows to attack.  
In an Ambush Attack, instead of being placed in the
standard checkerboard pattern at the back of a room, Enemies
are placed directly adjacent to the Heroes! If there are different
Initiatives with the Enemies being placed in an Ambush Attack,
the Enemies with the highest Initiative are placed first (so that
the faster Enemies have priority on selecting targets).  
Ambushing Enemies are placed adjacent to
the Heroes and gain +2 Initiative during the first
turn of the Fight.  
If a new group of Enemies is placed by Ambush while a
Fight is already going on, the new Enemies get the +2 Initiative
during the first turn of the Fight they are involved in, as do any
other Enemies already in the Fight that are the same specific
Type as the Ambushers (Tentacles, Drowned Dead, etc).  

### Enemy Placement
To determine exactly where the Ambushing Enemies are
placed, start with the highest Initiative group of Enemies and
place one model in any space adjacent to a Random Hero.
That Enemy is said to be targeting that Hero to attack.  
The next Enemy model is placed in any space adjacent
to a Random Hero with the least number of Enemies of that
Type targeting it and has at least one open space adjacent to
it. In this way, the Enemies are placed to be evenly spread,
targeting all of the different Heroes (though some Heroes will
likely have more Enemies placed adjacent to them than others,
due to limited open spaces). This process continues until all of
the Ambushing Enemies are placed targeting Heroes.  
Any Enemies that cannot be placed adjacent to a Hero,
due to lack of open spaces, are placed as close to the Heroes
as possible. These Enemies are not considered to be targeting
any specific Hero, yet.  

### Enemies Appearing Mid-Turn
On rare occasion, a new group of Enemies will Ambush
Attack during the Models Activate in Initiative Order portion of
the turn, usually by way of a Hero Scavenging and finding a
Darkness card. When this happens, the Enemies are placed
and the current turn immediately ends! A brand new turn
begins, starting the Fight. Note that this is not the case if
Enemies Ambush during the Hold Back the Darkness phase, as
the Activating of models has not yet started.  

## Turns During a Fight
Turns work much the same during a Fight as they do
when Enemies are not on the board, the main difference is
that the Enemies get to Activate as well as the Heroes. Also,
the Heroes will actually be attacking during their Activation,
instead of just moving and exploring.  

Enemies get to Activate first if their Initiative
is tied with a Hero.  

All Enemies of a specific Type (such as Tentacles or Temple
Guard) are Activated at the same time, as a group. If more
than one Enemy Type have the same Initiative, roll randomly
between them each turn to see which gets to Activate first.  
When a Type of Enemies is Activated, they will get to
Move and Attack just like a Hero would; they just get to do so
as a group. This is covered in detail below.  

### Fear, Terror, and Unspeakable Terror
Some especially scary creatures will cause Horror Hits
on Heroes just for being near them! These Enemies have an
Ability called Fear (x), Terror (x), or Unspeakable Terror
(x), and are defined on the Enemy’s Record Sheet.  
Fear does Horror Hits to adjacent Heroes, Terror does
Horror Hits to Heroes that are on the same Map Tile as it,
and Unspeakable Terror does Horror Hits if the Hero is on the
same or even adjacent Map Tile to the creature. The (x) is the
number of Horror Hits done.  
These abilities can be very effective at reducing a Hero’s
Sanity, as they stack up for each Enemy that causes them, and
they do the Horror Hits every turn as long as the Enemy is
alive.  
Note that Horror Hits only do 1 Sanity Damage each
unless specifically noted as doing more on the card or ability.  

### Hero Movement During a Fight
Heroes move normally during a Fight, with one exception.
If a Hero ever has an Enemy in an adjacent space to them,
the Hero must first try to Escape before starting or continuing
to move.

**Escape Tests**  
Every Enemy has an Escape value listed on their Record
Sheet. When a Hero is adjacent to that Enemy and wants to
move, they must first roll an Escape Test.  
To make an Escape Test, roll a D6. If the result is equal
to or higher than the Enemy’s Escape value, the test is passed
and the Hero may move for the rest of this turn ignoring any
adjacent Enemies that have that Escape value or lower.  
For example, if a Hero is adjacent to an Enemy with a 4+
Escape value, they must roll a 4, 5, or 6 on a D6 to be able to move.
Once they do, however, for the rest of the turn, that Hero may move
past any adjacent Enemy with an Escape value of 4+, 3+, or 2+.  
If the Hero becomes adjacent to another Enemy with a
higher Escape value (ie - 5+ or 6+ in the previous example),
they must stop their move and make a new Escape Test with
the higher difficulty to keep going.  

**No Searching or Room Exploration**  
As noted in the section on Hero Movement, Searching
and Room Exploration may not be done during a Fight (this
includes Scavenging as the Heroes are a little busy).  

### Hero Attacks
After a Hero has moved, they are allowed to make one
Attack. This can be a Melee Attack using their basic Combat
value, or a Ranged Attack using a Ranged Weapon like a
Crossbow or Gun.  

**Melee Attacks**  
Every Hero has a built-in Melee Attack available to them
in the form of their Combat value. This represents the Hero
punching, kicking, or using simple improvised weapons. A
Melee Attack uses the Hero’s basic Combat value, which is
usually 2, as well as any bonuses they may have from Items or
Abilities. A Melee Attack may only target adjacent Enemies,
so you will need to get up close to use it.  

A Hero’s Combat value is the number of dice
they get to roll when making a Melee Attack.  

A Hero can use any number of Items and Abilities they
have to add bonuses to their Melee Attack as long as they
observe all relevant restrictions (such as having no more than
2 {One Handed} worth of Items equipped, etc).  

**Ranged Attacks**  
Ranged Attacks are provided by a Ranged Weapon the
Hero has, such as a Bow or Gun. These Items are listed as
having a Range as well as a number of Shots.  
Range is the number of spaces away that an Enemy can
be and still be hit by the Attack.  
Shots is the number of dice the Hero gets to roll for a
Ranged Attack made with that Weapon.  

**Roll 'To Hit'**  
Every Hero has two different ‘To Hit’ values listed on
their Character Sheet - Melee To Hit and Ranged To Hit. Melee
To Hit is used when making a Melee Attack and Ranged To
Hit is used when making a Ranged Attack.  
The Hero rolls their dice and each roll that is equal to or greater than their appropriate ‘To Hit’ value counts as one Hit.
Any dice that rolled a 6+ counts as a Critical Hit and gets a
special bonus when rolling for Damage.  

**Assigning Hits**  
After all of the Hero’s dice have been rolled and the
number of Hits determined, the Hero is allowed to assign
those Hits, one at a time, to any Enemies within Range.  

Hits may always be assigned and resolved
one at a time, or in groups. It is your choice.  

For Melee Attacks, Hits may only be assigned to adjacent
Enemies.  

For Ranged Attacks, Hits may be assigned to any Enemies
within the Range of the Weapon and within the Hero’s Line
of Sight. However...  

If there are Enemies adjacent to you, you
must always assign and resolve Ranged Hits
against them first.  

If your initial Hits kill all Enemies adjacent to you, you
may then begin assigning subsequent Ranged Hits to other
Enemies.  

### Line of Sight
To be able to see an Enemy and assign Hits to them,
you must be able to draw a straight line from the center of
the Hero’s space to the center of the target’s space without
it crossing a Wall (the thick black border of the Map Tiles).
Only Walls block Line of Sight; other models have no effect
on it.  

### Line of Sight Example
Since this is a text only example with no visual diagrams, let's imagine a Map Tile on the table with each space number and display as below as columns and rows:  
```
         |11|12|
|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|  
   |20|21|22|23|24|25|  
         |26|27|  
         |28|29|  
```

In addition to the layout of the map tile diagram above:  
  - The Hero is in space 28.
  - Enemy A is on space 18.
  - Enemy B is on space 25.
  - The northeast corner of space 17 is blocked by a wall.
  - The southeast corner of space 23 is blocked by a wall.

In this example, the Hero would have Line of Sight to Enemy A but line of sight to Enemy B would be blocked.  

### Rolling for Damage
Each successful Hit that the Hero scored on an Enemy
does D6 Damage to that Enemy. These Damage rolls are
made separately for each Hit (though all Damage rolls for Hits
assigned to a single target may be rolled together so that the
Hero may use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of them).  

### Enemy Defense
Enemy Defense works a little bit differently than Hero
Defense. Instead of being a saving roll that
the Enemy gets (which would be a little
cumbersome), an Enemy’s Defense value is
simply subtracted from the Damage that each
incoming Hero Hit would do. The remaining
Damage after Defense is the number of
Wounds actually done to that Enemy.  
So, for example, if a Hero scores 2 Hits and rolls a 3 and a 5 for
Damage, an Enemy with Defense 3 would take a total of 2 Wounds
(Damage 3 - Defense 3 =0 and Damage 5 - Defense 3 =2).  

### Critical Hits
As noted above, any Hero To Hit rolls of 6+ count as
Critical Hits! These special Hits allow you to ignore an
Enemy’s Defense and apply all of the Damage that Hit does
directly to the Enemy’s Health. This can be very powerful,
allowing you to wound or kill an Enemy, even if it has a fairly
high Defense value.  

### Wounding and Killing an Enemy
When a Hero does one or more Wounds to an Enemy,
Wound markers should be placed by that Enemy model to
track how much damage it has taken. These Wounds stay on
that Enemy until it is killed.  
An Enemy is killed as soon as it has a number of Wounds
equal to its Health. When an Enemy is killed, it is immediately
removed from the board and the Hero that caused the last
Wound gains XP.  

### Enemies with Armor
Some Enemies have an ability that gives them Armor (Note
that the ‘Armor’ ability is different from normal ‘Defense’).
Applying damage to an Enemy with Armor requires an extra
step. After you have determined how much Damage a Hit has
done to the Enemy, and subtracted the Enemy’s Defense value,
you must then roll an extra D6 for each individual Wound you
are about to cause. For each roll that is equal to or higher than
the Enemy’s Armor value, that Wound is prevented.  
For example, a Hero does 2 Hits to an Enemy model that has
Defense 4 and Armor 5+. The Damage rolls for those 2 Hits are 5
and 6. This would normally cause 3 Wounds total to the Enemy (5 -
Defense 4 = 1 Damage, and 6 - Defense 4 = 2 Damage, for a total
of 3 Damage). But before the Damage is applied, the player must
roll 3 dice for the Enemy’s Armor (one for each individual point of
Damage). For each roll of 5 or 6 (Armor 5+), that individual Wound
is prevented by the Armor.  

### Collecting XP
Every Enemy has an XP value listed on its Record Sheet,
just below its Health. For smaller Enemies, this XP value is
the amount of XP gained by a Hero that kills it (causes the last
Wound which removes it from the board).  
For larger Enemies, this XP value works a bit differently
and is marked as a Base number of XP ‘+5 Each’. For these
larger Enemies, Heroes gain XP just for Wounding them. This
allows all of the Heroes to get XP for doing their part in helping to take down a larger creature.  
During a Hero’s Attack, the Base XP is gained once if the
Hero does any Wounds at all to the Enemy model, and the ‘+5
Each’ is gained for each Wound done to that Enemy model
across all of the Hero’s Hits during the Attack.  
For example, if a Hero scores 2 Hits on a large Enemy with
‘10XP +5 Each’ as its XP value, and those Hits do 2 Wounds and 4
Wounds after the Enemy’s Defense, the Hero would gain a total of
40 XP (10 XP for Wounding the target as well as +5 XP for each of
the six Wounds actually caused: 10+30 = 40 XP).  
As noted earlier, Elite Enemies are worth +5 XP per Elite
ability they have. This is only added to the base XP value for
larger Enemies that give XP per Wound.  

### Free Attacks
Some cards and abilities give
a Hero a Free Attack. A Free
Attack is a special type of Attack
that a Hero may use during their
Activation, and is in addition
to their normal Attack. It can
be made either before or after
making a normal Attack.  

No more than 1 Free
Attack may be made by a
Hero in a single turn.  

A Free Attack is Exhausted when used
(unless discarded)and lists in ( ) how often it may be used
(that is, when the player may Ready the Item or Ability that
grants the Free Attack). This is usually Once per Fight or Once
per Adventure.  
Free Attacks are always listed as either a Ranged Attack
or Melee Attack.  
Ranged Free Attacks have a Range as well as number of
Shots used for the Attack.  
Melee Free Attacks have a listed Combat value that is
used instead of the Hero’s Combat value. They do NOT gain
any Combat bonuses or modifiers that would normally affect
the Hero’s Melee Attacks, such as those granted by other Hand
Weapons that are equipped.  

### Throwing a Bomb or Dynamite
A Hero may throw a Bomb or Dynamite Token as a
Ranged Attack. The Range of the throw is up
to the Hero’s Strength +3 and it may be thrown
at ANY space in Range as long as the Hero has
Line of Sight to that space (even if
Enemies are adjacent to the Hero).  
Roll once To Hit. If successful,
the Bomb lands in the targeted space
and explodes. If the To Hit roll was
missed, the Bomb will instead Bounce
D3 times in Random Directions before
exploding. Use the D8 to determine
the direction of each space the Bomb
Bounces into.  
When the Bomb explodes, it does
D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense, to each model in the same
and adjacent spaces to it. Roll the Damage for each model
separately.  

Since the Bounce Diagram image for Bombs and Dynamite cannot be shown, the direction of a Bounce using a D8 can be easily mapped to cardinal directions in a text description. The direction of each Bounce according to each possible D8 result is:  
1. NW
2. N
3. NE
4. E
5. SE
6. S
7. SW
8. W

## Enemy Movement
When a Type of Enemy is Activated, they get to Move and
then Attack as a group.  

### Activating an Enemy Type
As discussed above, all of the Enemies of a specific Type
are Activated together when their Initiative comes up in the
turn order. When Activated, the first thing that the Enemies do
is to Target Heroes and move towards them to Attack.  

### Targeting Heroes and Movement
Though all of the Enemies of a specific Type are Activated
together, they choose their targets and move one at a time,
starting with the Enemy model that is closest to the Heroes. If
more than one are at equal distance to the nearest Hero, you
may choose the order that they are moved in.  
The first Enemy model targets a Random Hero that they
can reach - within their Move distance (printed on the Enemy
Record Sheet) and with a clear path to get there. That Enemy
is said to be targeting the selected Hero to Attack and is moved
as far as it can be to a space adjacent to that Hero. This will
usually have the Enemy move to the far side of the Hero,
getting in behind them and making way for other Enemies.  
It is often a good idea to have the Enemy models physically
turned to face the Hero they are targeting so that it is very clear
where each Enemy is placing its Attacks.  
Then, the next closest Enemy model will target a different
Random Hero with the least number of Enemies of that Type
targeting it and is within reach. In this way, the Enemies are
moved to be evenly spread, targeting all of the different Heroes
(though some Heroes will likely have more Enemies reach
them than others, due to paths being blocked or not enough
movement). This process continues until all of the Activating
Enemies have been moved.  
Any Enemies that cannot reach a Hero will move as far
as they can toward the nearest Hero. These Enemies are not
considered to be targeting any specific Hero yet.  

### Staying on Target
Once an Enemy targets a Hero, it will continue to target
and attack that Hero until they are KO’d or until the Hero is
no longer adjacent. Enemies do NOT change target based on
who is attacking them.  

### Choosing a New Target
If the Hero being targeted by an Enemy moves away or is
KO’d, at the start of the Enemy’s next Activation it will select a
new Hero using the same process described above.  
In this way, if a Hero is feeling overwhelmed, they can
always try to Escape and run away in the hopes that the
Enemies targeting them will choose a new and different target
during their next Activation.  

### Large Enemies
Large Size Enemies have a special built-in ability to brush
aside and push past smaller Enemies to reach the Heroes.
Whenever a Large Size Enemy (or bigger) is selecting a
target Hero, they may move through other Enemies that are
Medium or Small Size that would normally block their path.
As the Large Enemy moves, it may enter a Medium/Small
Enemy’s space, displacing that smaller Enemy into the space
that the Large Enemy just left. In this way, the Large Enemy
swaps places with the smaller one to push past it and get closer
to the Hero.  
Large Enemies may displace any number of Small/
Medium Enemies like this during their move to reach their
target Hero. They may not, however, displace other Large
Size Enemies or Heroes to reach their target.  

## Enemy Attacks
Once all of the currently Activating Enemies have targeted
a Hero and been moved, it is time for each of them to Attack!  

### Rolling 'To Hit'
Rolling To Hit for Enemy Attacks works just like it does
for a Hero Attack. The only difference is that Enemies DO
NOT get Critical Hits on rolls of 6+. Some Enemies do,
however, have special Abilities which might be triggered by
To Hit rolls of 6+ (such as Tentacles with their Smash Ability).  
Each Enemy rolls a number of dice equal to their Combat
value against the Hero it is targeting. Every die that successfully
rolls equal to or greater than the Enemy’s ‘To Hit’ value causes
one Hit on the Hero.  
Note that as the game itself is playing the Enemies, it is
up to other players to actually roll the dice for the Enemies’
Attacks. A player should not roll the Enemy Attacks on their
own Hero (that would be bad form). Instead, one of the other
players should roll the dice for the Enemy Attacks against you.
It is usually good to simply always roll the Enemy Attacks
against the player to your left, or to just exchange (“I’ll roll the
Enemy Attacks on you and you roll the Attacks against me”).  
As a general rule, all of the Attacks on a Hero from
models in the current Enemy Group should be rolled at the
same time (as one big group of dice).  

### Hero Defense Rolls
For each Hit a Hero takes, they must make a Defense roll
to attempt to block it.  
If Attacked by multiple models from the same Enemy
Group, it is recommended that the Hero rolls all of their
Defense dice at the same time (to speed up game play and
allowing you to Re-roll all of your missed Defense rolls for
those Attacks with a single Grit).  

### Taking Damage
For each Hit that the Hero failed to block with their
Defense, they take a number of Wounds equal to the Enemy’s
Damage value.  

## Completing a Fight
Once all of the Enemies on the board have been defeated,
the Fight immediately ends and it is time for the Heroes to
Catch Your Breath, Recover from being KO’d, and collect Loot
for the Fight.  

This immediately ends the current turn, as
well as the Fight itself.  

### Catching Your Breath
Each Hero is allowed to Catch Your Breath at the end of
every Fight, Healing D3 Wounds/Sanity (any mix).  
If the Fight ended before a Hero got to Activate, or take
any Actions, that Hero instead gets to Heal D6 Wounds/
Sanity (any mix) or Recover 1 Grit. This is an extra bonus for
each Hero that didn’t get an Activation in the last Fight round.  

### Recovering From Being KO'd
Any Hero that was KO’d during the Fight now gets to
Recover, placing their figure back on the board and Healing 2D6 Wounds/Sanity (any
mix) They do, however, also need to roll
once on the Injury Chart or Madness Chart
(Injury if their Health was reduced to 0,
Madness if their Sanity was reduced to 0). This represents
any long-lasting effects of being KO’d.  
In the event that both a Hero’s Health and Sanity were
reduced to 0 at the same time, they must roll an Injury and a
Madness, but they are allowed to Heal 2D6 Health and 2D6
Sanity.  

### Drawing Loot Cards
After a Fight, the Heroes get Loot for their hard work.  

At the end of a Fight, every Hero is allowed
to draw one Loot card for each Threat card that
added Enemies to the Fight (to a max of 3 Loot
Cards each).  

This also includes each instance of Enemies that were
added to the Fight by other means, such as a Darkness or
Encounter card, or the Depth Event chart.  
The Loot Deck has no discard pile and should be fully
shuffled before the Heroes draw one or more cards from it.
All of the Heroes draw from the Loot Deck at the same time.
If there are not enough Loot cards to cover all of those that
need to be drawn by the Heroes, the Loot Deck would need to
be shuffled before the remaining Heroes could finish drawing.  

### Dark Stone and Gold
Dark Stone and Gold are
the two main currencies of
the game and are the most
common reward that can be
found in the Loot Deck.  
Gold represents a mixture
of coins and raw ore that can
be found on an Adventure.
The Gold prices listed on Items
are meant to reflect the abstract
nature of having a generalized
‘money’ currency and the overinflated
economy of a region
engulfed in chaos, where equipment is in
short supply.  
Gold is really only used when keeping Heroes from
game to game and can be spent when visiting Camp between
Adventures. Dark Stone is mainly used for the Campaign
game as well, for forging Items and Upgrades in Camp,
though several Items and abilities are fueled by Dark Stone
even during an Adventure.  

## Enemy Behavior Special Rules

### Shootout
Models with Shootout will generally
attempt to stay back, away from the
Heroes, and attack them from a distance.
The rules for Shootout are summarized on
the Shootout Reference card, but are also covered
here in greater detail. 

**Ambushing**  
When a group of Enemies with the
Shootout Standard Ability needs to be placed
in Ambush, they are not placed adjacent to
the Heroes like other Enemies. Instead, select
a Random Hero and place all of the Shootout Enemies from
that group on the selected Hero’s Map Tile, as far from any
Heroes as possible. This usually allows them to sneak in from
a side passage or get placed at the end of a hall or room,
maybe even behind the Heroes. If there are not enough empty
spaces on that Map Tile, any remaining Enemies are placed as
far from the Heroes as possible on any Map Tiles adjacent to
the selected Hero.  

**Retreating**  
When an Enemy with Shootout starts its Activation
adjacent to one or more Heroes, it will usually try to move
away. Roll a D6 for the Enemy model. On the roll of 4, 5,
or 6, the Enemy immediately makes a Free Move along the
shortest distance to no longer be adjacent to any Heroes. This
Free Move is outside of the Enemy’s normal Move and does
not count against its Movement allowance for the turn.  

**Melee Attacks**  
Any Shootout Enemy that failed to Retreat (or was stuck
adjacent to a Hero, and could not move away), will make a
normal Combat Attack against a Random adjacent Hero this
turn, instead of their Ranged Attack.  

**Shootout Markers**  
hootout markers are used to denote which
Heroes have been targeted, and by how many
Enemy Ranged Attacks. Any suitable markers can
be used for this. Shootout markers are a simple
way to keep track of which Heroes have already been
targeted, and by how many of the Enemies.  

**Targeting**  
After any Retreat moves, the Shootout Enemies that
are not adjacent to a Hero, will each find a Target for their
Ranged Attacks. Step through the Shootout Enemies, one by
one, completing the following procedure for each of them.  
Select a Random Hero that does not have a Shootout
marker on him yet (or that has the fewest Shootout markers
if all Heroes already have one) and move the shortest distance
to get within Range and Line Of Sight to that Target. The
Enemy may not end its Move adjacent to any Heroes. The
Enemy MAY move through other Enemies from its group
during this movement, as they make way for one another.  
At the end of this Move, if the selected Target is within
Range and Line Of Sight, place a Shootout marker on that
Target. If not, select a new Random Hero that is currently
within Range and Line Of Sight to the Enemy (prioritizing
those with the fewest Shootout markers) and place a Shootout
marker on him instead.  
Then proceed to the next Enemy in the group.  

**Making Ranged Attacks**  
Once all of the Enemy Group has moved and
placed their Shootout markers, roll Ranged Attacks
from the Enemies against each Hero equal to
the number of Shootout markers on that Hero.
Then, remove all of the Shootout markers.  

## Advanced Rules
The following are Advanced Rules that are meant to be integrated into the game after you are comfortable with the basics
and want to add in the rest of the game features. These mainly include the Epic Threat boss enemies, the Campaign system of
keeping Heroes from game to game, and stepping through gateways to OtherWorlds!  

### Epic Threats
Epic Threat cards represent much larger
and deadlier boss Enemies that are rare to
come across and hard to defeat. These are
most often used only for final Objective
Room fights as noted in the details of each
individual Mission.  

**1 or 2 Heroes**  
With Hero Parties of only 1 or 2
Heroes, anytime an Epic Threat would be
needed, draw a High Threat card instead. Fighting the
massive boss Enemies often found on Epic Threats can be
overly difficult for only 1 or 2 characters to handle. Of course,
if you are ambitious, you can use Epic Threats anyway, but
you have been warned!  

## Status Effect Markers
Sometimes an Encounter or Enemy Attack will continue
to affect a Hero for some time after the initial event. These
effects are represented by Status Effect markers which are
placed on a Hero and have on ongoing effect.  

### Poison
Poison is a deadly and long lasting effect that can wear a
Hero down over time. A Hero may gain 1 or more
Poison markers from Encounters, Enemy attacks, or
even environmental effects; such as moving through
a cloud of toxic gas.  
Every turn in which a Hero has one or
more Poison markers on them at the start of their
Activation, they must roll a D6 for each Poison marker
they currently have. On the roll of 1 or 2, the Hero takes 1
Wound, ignoring Defense (as well as any Armor/Shield). On
the roll of 3, 4, or 5, there is no effect for that marker. On the
roll of 6, the Poison has worn off and the marker is discarded.
If a Hero is KO’d (or at the end of the Adventure), all Poison
markers on them are automatically removed.  

### Bleeding
Bleeding markers represent deep wounds or particularly
nasty burns by acid or steam. For each Bleeding marker
a model has, it is -3 Health. Note that because this
is a negative modifier to the model’s actual Health
value, it cannot be Healed like Wounds.  
A Hero may
spend a Grit at any
time to remove a
Bleeding marker (note
that Ambition may
NOT be used for
this).  

## Immobile Enemies
Though not very common, some Enemies have an Ability
that makes them Immobile, meaning that they cannot move.
Immobile Enemies usually will either have a Ranged Attack
to use against the Heroes, or be a Spawner, generating new
Enemies for the Heroes to fight until the Spawner can be
destroyed.  

### Ambush with Immobile Enemies
When placing Immobile Enemies during an Ambush
Attack, roll a Random Hero’s Map Tile and place the Immobile
Enemies on that Map Tile in spaces that are as far from any
Heroes as possible (not in the standard Checkerboard fashion).
It is assumed that they were already there and that the Heroes
did not see them until it’s too late.  
Ambushing Immobile Enemies should be placed before
any other Enemies.  

### Escaping From Immobile Enemies
While Immobile Enemies are the only Enemies on the
board, Heroes may Explore (Look Through Doors and
Scavenge) during the Fight. At the start of any turn, remove
any Immobile Enemies from the board that are not within 18
spaces of a Hero. These Enemies do not count as having been
defeated and no XP or Loot card is gained from them.  
In this way, the Heroes may decide to escape from
Immobile Enemies rather than stay to fight them.  
Note that, because many Immobile Enemies are Spawners,
as soon as an Enemy model is Spawned onto the board that
is not Immobile, the Heroes lose the option to Explore and
escape like this until that new Enemy model is defeated.  

## Immune To...
Sometimes a model will be Immune to a certain type of
Damage, Critical Hits, or even particular types of Status Effect
markers.  

### Immune to <Keyword>
If a model is Immune to a certain Keyword (such as Fire
or Weather), that means that the model may ignore all of the
effects and Damage from any Source that is using an ability or
Item with that Keyword.  

### Immune to Critical Hits
Some Enemies have the Tough ability, making them
Immune to Critical Hits. For these models, Critical
Hits from a Hero do not ignore the Enemy’s Defense,
though any other special bonuses triggered for rolling a
Critical Hit may still take effect.  

### Immunity and Status Effect Markers
If a model is Immune to a certain type of Status Effect
marker, that means that markers of that type are never placed
on that model.  

## Extra Large Enemies
Some Enemies are so large and menacing that they take
up multiple spaces on the game board! These are usually boss
creatures and are part of an Epic Threat Fight.  

### Extra Large Base Size
Extra Large Size Enemies actually take up four spaces on
the board in a 2x2 square. When one of these Enemies is being
placed on the board, it uses a single one of its four spaces as
the anchor space for placement and should be positioned so
that the rest of the base is placed into spaces that are viable and
have no other models in them.  

### Movement
When moving, once again the Enemy uses a single one of
its four spaces as an anchor space for counting movement and
distance to a Hero.  
Just like Large Size Enemies, an Extra Large Enemy may
brush aside and push past any Small or Medium Size Enemies
in its way, swapping spaces with them as it goes (it just usually
moves them two spaces back, instead of one, to account for its
larger base size).  

### Overflowing the Board
In some cases, the only way for an Extra Large Enemy
to reach a Hero is to smash through the walls to get to them.
This is called Overflowing the Board and allows the Enemy to
hang off the edge of the Map Tiles to fit into a smaller space
than their base would normally allow. The Enemy must keep
at least half of its base on the board at the end of its move.  

### Area Effect and Extra Large Bases
Even though an Extra Large Enemy takes up multiple
spaces on the board, they are only ever affected once by
weapons and abilities that target an area (like a Bomb for
instance). Even if the explosion would cover two or more
spaces that the Enemy base is in, the Enemy is still only
affected by it once.  

## Enemy Ranged Attacks
Some Enemies have Abilities that give them a Ranged
Attack to battle the Heroes with.  

### Targeting Heroes and Movement
Enemies with a Ranged Attack will target a Hero as
normal, however they will use the Range of their Ranged
Attack, rather than their Move value, to choose their targets.
This means that they will target a Random Hero based on the
Range of their Attack and Line of Sight rather than on their
Move and a clear Path, like a normal Enemy would. If there
are one or more Heroes adjacent to the Enemy, it will attempt
to target those Heroes first.  
Another aspect of this is that Enemies with a Ranged
Attack will re-target each turn instead of staying with a single
target that they keep attacking.  
These Enemies will generally not Move unless there are
no viable Hero targets for them to Attack. When this is the
case, the Enemy will move toward the nearest Hero until they
are in Range and Line of Sight, then select a target.  

### Ranged or Melee
value, it will only make a Melee Attack if there is an adjacent
Hero to it (the Enemy will not move to make a Melee Attack).
When choosing a target each turn, the Enemy will first select
a Random target from any adjacent Heroes, and if there are
none, it will then select a target at Range.  

### Extra Ranged Attacks
Some Enemies have a Ranged Attack as part of a special
ability that they perform in addition to their normal Melee
Attack (usually at the beginning of their Activation or at the
end of their move). These extra Ranged Attacks do not change
the Enemy’s normal behavior and do not effect how the Enemy
Targets and moves to make its normal Melee Attack.  

## Helping a KO'd Hero
When a Hero gets KO’d during a Fight, it can often be
a slippery slope to defeat for the rest of the party. There are
some ways though that the other Heroes can try to help the
fallen get back into the fight!  

### Recovering a KO'd Hero mid-Fight
A Hero that is adjacent to a KO’d Hero marker may give
up their Attack to help that Hero Recover. This may only be
done as long as there are no Enemies on the same Map Tile
as the KO’d Hero marker. The KO’d Hero immediately rolls
on the Injury/Madness chart as appropriate and Heals their
2D6 Wounds/Sanity (any mix) as normal. Their figure is
placed back onto the board, but they do not get an Activation
in the same turn that they Recover (they are still a bit dazed).  

### Dragging a KO'd Hero
Any Hero in the same or adjacent space to a KO’d Hero
marker may drag that Hero with them while they move. To
do so, simply use 1 extra movement point for each space you
want to move while dragging the KO’d Hero (so 2 move per
space).  
The KO’d Hero marker will be moved along with you as
you go and left in your space (if you started dragging them
while in the space with the marker), or the last space you
moved from if you were adjacent to them. This can be useful
for getting a KO’d Hero to the safety of a Map Tile with no
Enemies so that you can try to help them Recover.  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone can be played Solo or expanded to
support up to 5 or 6 Heroes.  

### A 5 or 6 Hero Game
A 5 or 6 Player game can be achieved by getting a second
Core/Adventure Set or additional Hero Classes to play as.
This works the same as all of the rules detailed so far, and the
difficulty scaling is already listed for the higher player count on
page 11. It is not recommended that you try playing with more
than 6 Heroes as the difficulty scaling does not work very well
with that many Heroes, and the game will start to drag with
so many players.  

### Solo Game
The game can easily be played Solo and is fun whether
controlling a single Hero or a full party of your own! One
Hero makes for an exciting, albeit deadly, game. This method
makes use of the Revive Tokens to keep you going and can be
looked at almost as extra lives. Does your Hero have what it
takes to go it alone?  

### Multiple Heroes of the Same Class
Multiple Heroes of the Same Class
One thing that can be very fun is to play a Hero Party
with more than one of the same Hero Class/Sub-Class, or
even a Party where all of the Heroes are the same Hero Class.
Having a Party of Duelists fence their way through every battle
or a group of Explorers setting out on a mission to locate a
lost relic can create a lot of cool gameplay and story moments!  

### Hero Attack Dice Limit
There is a limit on the number of dice a Hero may roll
for a single Attack. This is called a Hero’s Attack Dice Limit.
Heroes have an Attack Dice Limit of 8, which means:  

A Hero may not roll more than 8 Combat or
8 Shots for a single Attack.  

This includes extra Combat or Shots gained during the
Attack, through Abilities and Items.  
Abilities that let a Hero do a number of Combat/Shots to
specific Enemies (such as ‘all Enemies adjacent’, etc) do not
count against the Hero’s Attack Dice Limit.  

### Dual Wielding Ranged Weapons
Normally a Hero is only allowed to make a Ranged
Attack with a single Ranged Weapon. However, a Hero that
has two Single-Handed Ranged Weapons may fire both as
a single Ranged Attack! This is called Dual Wielding. (Note
that the term Dual Wielding only applies to using two Ranged
Weapons, NOT for a Melee Attack with 2 Hand Weapons).  

There is a penalty to Dual Wielding though:  
The Attack may NOT get Critical Hits for
either of the two weapons.  

Rolls of 6+ count as normal Hits, though they may still
trigger special abilities or effects.  
In addition, the Hero must choose one of the Ranged
Weapons as being fired with their primary hand. The other
Ranged Weapon is considered to be in the Hero’s Off-Hand.  
Dice rolled for Off-Hand Ranged Weapons
need to roll 1 higher than normal on To Hit rolls.  
So shots that would normally need a 4+ To Hit would
need to roll 5+ with an Off-Hand Weapon. Natural To Hit rolls
of 6+ may still trigger special effects.  
It is a good idea to roll two different colors of dice for a
Dual Wielding Ranged Attack, where different colors of dice
are used for the Shots from each weapon.  

## Gates to Another World
Finding a Gateway to another World can be a very
exciting and dangerous event. This usually happens through
an Exploration Token with a Gate Icon or an Encounter that
adds a Gate to a Room.  

### Gate Icons
Gate Icons on Exploration Tokens work
just like Door Icons, but instead of leaving
the puzzle connection open, a Gate End Cap
is placed there.  

### Gate End Caps
Gate End Caps work very similar to Doors. Rather than
standing in one of the puzzle connection half-spaces to look
through the Doorway though, the Hero stands in the halfand-
half connection space adjacent to the blue swirling Gate
(half on the Map Tile and Half on the Gate End Cap) to look
through the Gate.  

### Looking Through a Gate
When a Hero looks through a Gate, they are seeing
through the portal and into another World, across space and
time...maybe even into another dimension! The Hero must
draw a World Card to see where the Gate leads.  

### Drawing a World Card
Each World Card
represents a different World
that is available to the Heroes
to explore. The Valley of the
Serpent Kings Set comes with
the Spanish Fort and one
OtherWorld. While in the
Spanish Fort, the Spanish Fort World Card should be face up near the Depth Track to show that it
is a World that Heroes are currently in. When a Hero looks
through an unexplored Gate, they must draw a World Card
randomly from those not currently in play. Because this Set
only includes one OtherWorld, the Swamps of Jargono - Valley
of the Serpent Kings, this will always be the World that you find
on the other side of a Gate.  
The newly drawn World Card should be placed face up on
the table near the Depth Track as well. There should be one
World Card in play for each World that one or more Heroes
is currently in. When there are no Heroes in that World any
longer, the card should be returned to the World Cards Deck.  

### OtherWorld Map Tiles
The OtherWorld Map Tiles are printed on the reverse side
of the Spanish Fort Map Tiles. There is also a full Map Deck
for the OtherWorld that represents each of the Map Tiles for
that World (just like the Spanish Fort Map Deck).  
Once you have determined the OtherWorld that is through
the Gate, you should draw a Map Card for that World and
put it into play. Then place a Gate End Cap for that World
attached to the Entrance of the newly placed OtherWorld Map
Tile. These two Gate End Caps are connected.  

### Break in the Map
To represent the distance through time and space that the
Gate spans, there is a break in the map whenever the Heroes
find a Gate. One side of the map ends in a Gate End Cap and
the other side begins with a connected Gate End Cap. These
two sections of the board do not need to touch and can be
positioned anywhere on the table relative to one another.  

The two spaces on one Gate End Cap are
considered to be adjacent to the two spaces on
the other Gate End Cap.  

### Exploration Tokens on the Other Side
If the Other World Map Tile placed on the far side of the
Gate is a Room, it will get an Exploration Token placed on
it as normal. Unlike finding a Room in the World you are
already in though, the Hero is simply looking through the
Gate, not actually standing on the new Map Tile (the Hero is
standing on their own side of the Map Tile/Gate End Cap, not
on the new Map Tile/Gate End Cap).  
Because of this, the Exploration Token will not be revealed
until a Room Exploration phase in which a Hero is actually on
the Map Tile with it. So a Hero will actually have to step
through the Gate to Explore the Room on the other side.  

### Movement Through a Gate
Because the two spaces on each side of the Gate are
considered to be adjacent to each other, models may move
through the Gate just as though the spaces on either side were
directly next to one another.  

### Seeing/Attacking Through a Gate
This works the same way for Attacking. Because the
spaces on either side are considered adjacent, a model may
Attack through the Gate. So if you are standing on one side of
the Gate, you may target Enemies on the other side.  
Line of Sight for Ranged Attacks, however, may not be
traced through the Gate unless you are standing on the Gate
End Cap itself looking directly through. This means that you
cannot stand back and just shoot across the room into another
World, but you can move up to the Gate and look through to
start taking shots.  

### Adjacent Map Tiles
If the Hero with the Light Source is standing on a Map
Tile with a Gate End Cap, the light will cover the Map Tile on
the other side of the Gate, as it is considered to be an adjacent Map Tile. This works the same for other effects that reach to
adjacent Map Tiles such as Unspeakable Terror, etc.  
An Enemy with Terror will affect Heroes in the two spaces
directly on the other side of that Gate, even though they are
not technically on the same Map Tile.  

### Encounters, Depth Events, and Ambush Attacks with Two Worlds
When an Encounter is drawn, only the Heroes that are
currently in the same World as that Encounter are affected by
its game text and involved with taking the tests on that card.  
Similarly, when an Ambush Attack occurs, the Enemies
will only be placed adjacent to and target Heroes that are in
the same World as the Ambush. If the Ambush was caused by
something that is not located in one World or another (such
as a Darkness card), select a Random Hero and the Ambush
takes place in the same World as that Hero.  
Depth Events are always assumed to take place in the
same World that the Light Source is in and will only affect
Heroes that are in that World with it. Note that each Other
World has its own unique Depth Event Chart to be used when
the Hero with the Light Source is in that World.  

## OtherWorlds
Each OtherWorld is intended to have a distinct look and
feel to it as the Heroes explore and find new, wondrous, and
sometimes deadly things there. This is achieved through
having a unique set of Map Tiles as well as Global Effects for
anyone in that World. There is also a small set of card decks
that are unique to that World. Each Core Set focuses on all of
the details of one of these OtherWorlds (as described in the
Adventure Book). More OtherWorlds can be found in other
Shadows of Brimstone Core Sets and Expansions.  

### World Cards and Global Effects
Every World (including the Spanish Fort) is represented
by a World Card. This World Card lists the Name of the
World as well as any Global Effects that apply to any Heroes
currently in that World.  

### Map Cards, Encounters, Artifacts, and OtherWorld Threats
Each OtherWorld has unique card decks for Map Cards,
Encounters, Artifacts, and OtherWorld Threats. While in
that OtherWorld, these card decks should be used in place of
the normal versions of these decks. When a card would be
drawn from one of these decks, simply use the OtherWorld
version of that deck instead. This is a relatively obvious switch
for each of these decks, with the exception of the OtherWorld
Threats.  
OtherWorld Threat cards represent Enemies that are
unique to the alien world you are in. Unlike the normal
Threat Decks that are split into Low, Med, and High Threats,
there is only one OtherWorld Threat Deck and each card in
it lists the result for Low (Green), Med (Yellow), and High
(Red) Threats. Normal Epic Threats are used for Other Worlds
as well, but any additional Threat cards they have you draw
should be from the OtherWorld Threat cards.  

### Loot Cards for Gear and Artifacts
You will likely have noticed that the Loot cards that allow
a Hero to draw a Gear card or an Artifact card have a special
note on them. While in an OtherWorld, these card effects are
actually reversed, so the Loot card that normally lets you draw
a Gear will give you an Artifact and vice versa. This is because
it is more likely for a Hero to find Gear in an Earth-based
world, while it is more likely to find an Artifact in a strange
alien environment.  

## Conquistador Footmen Allies
Conquistador Footmen Allies are extra fighters that you
can bring along with you on Adventures. These Allies can help
battle Enemies and have special abilities to aid in warding off
the Darkness. Because they are not full-fledged Heroes though,
their abilities and actions are a bit more limited than what a
Player Hero could do. They also are not nearly as tough as
Heroes and are far more likely to succumb to the horrors
encountered along the way. No one ever said the life of a
Conquistador Footmen would be easy.  
Conquistador Footmen Allies may be hired to join the
Hero Party between Adventures during the Camp Stay. The
Gold cost to hire an Ally is listed in the lower right corner of
the medium sized Ally reference sheet. As noted on the card,
Conquistador Footmen may only be hired by a Conquistador
Hero or a Hero that is Keyword Tribal. All of the Heroes in
this set are Conquistadors, but when adding other Expansion
Heroes, this becomes more important.  
Allies come in two varieties - Basic or Advanced.  

### Basic Allies
The Basic version of an Ally is represented
by a token and is more akin to a ‘one use’
item that can be discarded for a unique bonus
during the Adventure. The various uses of a
Basic Conquistador Footman Ally are listed on
the Basic side of the medium Ally reference sheet.
As listed on the sheet, any individual Hero may only have up
to 2 Basic Conquistador Footmen Allies at a time.  

### Advanced Allies
An Advanced Ally is closer to
an actual Hero (though not nearly
as strong). They have a model that
moves around the board and fights
just like a Hero, with their own
special abilities and gear. This also
means that they can be killed in a
Fight, or by the various dangers of
an expedition.  
The stats, abilities, and gear of
an Advanced Conquistador Footman
Ally can be found on the Advanced
side of the medium Ally reference sheet.  
It is important to note that the Hero Party may never have
more than 8 models total on the board, including Heroes and
Allies.  
Advanced Conquistador Footmen Allies are Activated just
like Heroes and should be moved, rolled for, etc by the Hero
Players (most likely by the specific Hero that hired them to
come along on the Adventure).  
An Advanced Conquistador Footman Ally is treated as
a Hero for all purposes, except for the following limitations:  
- May not get Critical Hits on Attacks
- May not carry or equip Items
- May not gain or use Grit or Ambition
- May not draw Loot cards
- May not Explore (Look through Doors
or Scavenge)
- Do not gain normal XP (they use Ally
XP instead)
- Are Targeted by Enemies normally, but
are never included for Skill tests

Once you have hired a Conquistador Footman Ally, they
stay with the Hero Party until killed, or you decide not to bring
them on an Adventure.  

### Ally Upgrades and Mutations
Advanced Conquistador
Footmen Allies do not gain normal
XP during an Adventure. Instead,
they gain 1 Ally XP at the end of
each successful Adventure that they
survive through. For a Conquistador
Footman, each Ally XP earned may be
spent to gain an Upgrade - roll a D6 and
consult the medium size Conquistador
Footmen Upgrade Sheet for details on this. In
this way, Conquistador Footman Allies can gain new abilities
and stat boosts if you can keep them alive long enough from
game to game.  
Similarly, an Advanced Conquistador Footman Ally has
a Corruption Resistance of 2 listed on their sheet. When they
have collected 2 Corruption Points, remove them and roll once
on the Conquistador Footmen Mutation Chart found on the
back of the Upgrade Sheet.  

### Death of an Ally and Camp
When an Advanced Ally is reduced to 0 Health or 0
Sanity, he is not KO’d, but rather killed and removed from the
board. Allies that are killed may NOT use Revive Tokens.  
An Ally that is killed may instead be ‘Revived’ between
Adventures by paying its Cost to Hire again, plus an additional
$200 for each Upgrade it has. This Ally retains all Upgrades
and Mutations.  
Between Adventures, Allies do NOT participate in a
Camp Stay with the Heroes (it is assumed that they have gone
off to tend to their own affairs or are quietly following along
without taking part).  

### Veteran Advanced Allies
As the Heroes advance in Level and begin facing Brutal
Enemies, normal Advanced Allies may be too fragile to be
viable. To account for this, once the Heroes reach Hero Party
Level 5, they now have the option to Hire Veteran Conquistador
Footmen which are double the Gold cost to Hire, but have
double their basic Health and Sanity values.  
If you are familiar with other Allies in Shadows
of Brimstone, you should note that these Conquistador
Footmen Allies work a little bit differently in that they are
very focused combat fighters. They do not have any Ally
Specialties and do NOT count toward the Hero Party
Size for determining Threat Level, etc. They also operate
under somewhat streamlined Ally Rules to make them
easier to use, as detailed above.  

## Campaign Play
Creating new Heroes and playing a single Adventure can
be a lot of fun, but keeping your Hero from game to game and
watching them grow over several missions in a Campaign is
an extremely rewarding process that allows the story and game
world to really shine. This also allows you to build and grow
your Expedition Camp between Adventures, as well as go up
in Hero Levels and get new Abilities and gear as you go!  

### At the End of Each Adventure
When playing a Campaign with your Heroes, at the end
of each Adventure, every Hero must do the following, in order:  
Recover if KO’d (rolling on the Injury/Madness Chart)
- Fully Heal your Health and Sanity
- Remove any Status Effect markers
- Resolve any Reward/Failure results of the Mission
- Roll for Corruption from Dark Stone
- Discard any unused Team Ability Cards
- Re-set your Hero Ability Tokens (Remove all Ambition)
- Re-set your Hero to 1 Grit for the Camp Stay

### Rolling for Dark Stone Corruption
At the end of an Adventure, each Hero must roll a D6
for every Dark Stone they are currently carrying (including
Items with a Dark Stone Icon). For every roll of 1, 2, or 3,
that Hero takes 1 Corruption Hit from the dark influence of
the Dark Stone. Willpower saves may be used to prevent these
Corruption Hits as normal.  

### Setting Up Your Camp/Town Stay
One exciting element of Campaign play is having the
ability for your Heroes to build their Expedition Camp. The
Camp can be visited between each Adventure to re-stock and
re-supply, as well as to spend your resources on powerful new
gear and bonuses by upgrading the Camp over time. Visiting
your Expedition Camp and Upgrading the Camp are covered
in detail in other sections.  

### At the Start of Each Adventure
After completing your Camp Stay, the Heroes will be
ready to start their next Adventure. To do so, the Heroes must
do the following steps, in order:  
- Select the next Mission to be played. If playing through
the Valley of the Serpent Kings Campaign this will usually be
the next Mission in the narrative.
- Re-set your Hero Ability Tokens (Conquistadors
generally start each Adventure with 1 Ambition).
- Re-set your Hero to 1 Grit for the new Adventure
- Note that any Wounds and Sanity Damage taken during
the Camp Stay remain with the Hero for the start of the
next Adventure.
- Draw Team Ability Cards

## Inuries, Madness, and Death
As noted previously, any time a Hero is KO’d during an
Adventure, they must roll on the Injury or Madness chart to
determine how bad off they really are (depending if they were
KO’d by loss of Health or Sanity). The results on these charts
range from getting the wind knocked out of you to being torn
to pieces and killed.  

### Healing Injuries and Madness in Camp
Injuries and Madness can have significant effects on a
Hero’s ability to keep Adventuring. Good news though,
there is a way to try to Heal or remove most of these longlasting
effects by returning to your Expedition Camp between
Adventures and visiting the Anchored Ship or the Camp Fire.  
At the Anchored Ship you can get Surgery to attempt to
repair an Injury or have an unwanted Mutation removed. This
can be somewhat expensive and there is no guarantee that it
will work, but hey, if you want to keep adventuring into the
dark halls of the Spanish Fort with a Broken Leg or a Void
Infection, that’s up to you.  
Much like the Anchored Ship, visiting the Camp Fire allows
you to try to Exorcise Madness that plagues your mind. This
Location also offers ways to remove Corruption before it turns
into a full blown Mutation.  

### Death of a Hero
On rare occasions, a Hero will actually be killed. This is
a harsh reality of being an explorer, especially when you are
fighting off demons and madness at every turn. When a Hero
is killed, it is assumed that the rest of the party brings their
body back to Camp to try to get them resurrected (or at least
for a proper burial). A Dead Hero may not be looted for their
Items and equipment.  

### Resurrection in Camp
One of the options available to a party that has lost one
of their own is to visit the Anchored Ship in Camp and pay to
have that Hero Resurrected. It can be quite expensive though!  
Any or all of the other Heroes in the party may contribute
Gold toward the cost for the Resurrection, including the Dead
Hero himself (selling his Items if need be to pay for the cost).  
Resurrecting a Dead
Hero is not time-sensitive
(though they may start
to smell a bit), and if
need be, you can even
start a new Hero and
try to build up enough
Gold to pay for your
other Dead Hero’s
Resurrection after
some time.  

## Optional Rules
This section covers Optional Rules that can be added to the game as long as all of the players agree before the game begins.
These Optional Rules are all independent of one another and should each be considered on an individual basis. The rules for
Fixed Hero Move and Hard-Core Mode are not recommended, but are made available for players that want them.  

### Fixed Hero Move
(Makes the game Less Difficult)  

As an option for players that do not like the idea of rolling
for movement each turn, they may use the Fixed Hero Movement
Optional Rule. With this rule, all Heroes are allowed to move
4 spaces each turn (plus any bonuses or negatives for Items,
Abilities, or Injuries/Mutations they may have).  

### Advanced Encounters
(Makes the game More Difficult)  

Every Unique Room Map Tile
has a specific theme to it, and there
is a matching Encounter card in the
Encounter Deck that shares that
theme. At the bottom of each Map
Card that represents a Unique Room
is a red band that lists the specific
Encounter associated with that
room.  
When using the Advanced
Encounters Optional Rule, any
time a Unique Room is Explored,
the listed Advanced Encounter is
added to that Exploration. Search
the Encounter Deck (and discard
Pile if needed) to find the listed Encounter card
(shuffle the deck afterwords). This is in addition to any other
Encounters or Attacks listed on the Exploration Token. Also,
Advanced Encounters like this cannot be canceled or re-drawn.  

### Below the Darkness
(Makes the game More Difficult)

One way to make the game more deadly is to use the
Below the Darkness Optional Rule. Whenever the Darkness
marker passes the Hero Party marker on the Depth Track
(positioned on a higher numbered step than the Hero Party
marker), from that point forward, all Enemies get a free Elite
Ability as the Darkness has grown ever stronger!  

### Hard-Core Mode
(Makes the game Much More Difficult)  
For players that want a truly Hard Core experience, you
may play Hard-Core Mode. In Hard-Core Mode, any time
a Hero would be KO’d they are instead killed unless they
Recover before the start of the next turn.  
This is a very unforgiving play style and will likely lead
to one or more players having to sit out the remainder of
the game while the rest of the group keeps adventuring (not
generally very fun). It is also especially dangerous for higher
level Heroes, as one bad situation can kill the character you
have been playing for months. Ouch!  
For a slightly softer version of Hard-Core Mode, you
can use the above, but allow Heroes to still be Resurrected
between Adventures in Camp.  

### Themed Threat Decks
(Can make the game More or Less Difficult)  
As more Enemy Types become available and players start
making their own Missions, one fun way to create a Themed
Adventure is to tailor-make your Threat Decks to only include
cards with certain Enemy Types. In this way, you could make
an area that is overrun with nothing but Serpentmen Enemies
or perhaps have a theme of only Void creatures that have spilled
out of a portal and are pouring out of the shadows.  
This can be done with just a single Adventure Set, but
really opens up once you have more Enemy Types available
to you. It is also very simple to do as the Threat Decks are all
card based and can easily be Themed or shuffled back together
at the start of each Adventure.  

### Dangerous Bombs
(Makes the game More Difficult)  
Black powder bombs can be a very powerful tool to
take out groups of Enemies or do some damage against high
Defense targets. Thematically though, it is a dangerous thing
to just be carrying around in your Side Bag with you.  
To represent this extra element of danger, you may elect
to use the Dangerous Bombs Optional Rule. Any time a Hero
takes 10 or more Wounds from a single source, they must roll
a D6 for each Bomb Token they have in their Side Bag. For
each roll of 1 or 2, that Token immediately explodes, centered
on the Hero’s space.  

### Combining Sets
When combining this Adventure Set with other Adventure
Sets (such as the Gates of Valhalla), all of the components can
be seamlessly added together, shuffling card decks that have the
same card back together and allowing for a mixed Hero Party
from different genres, having crossed through portals to team
up against the Darkness..  
The only components not recommended to be mixed
together when combining Adventure Sets are the Loot Deck,
Scavenge Deck, and the stack of Exploration Tokens.  
You will also note that several of the card decks, such as
Gear, Darkness, and Growing Dread, have a unique icon in
the upper left corner of the card face that denotes the genre it
is from (Viking, Conquistador, Feudal Japanese, etc). These
cards do share the same card back across sets, and can be fully
mixed together, but they can also be kept separate to be drawn
only while in the corresponding environments to maintain the
theme, if desired.  
When combing this Adventure Set with one of the larger
Core Sets (such as City of the Ancients), you will find that
the Loot Deck, Scavenge Deck, and Exploration Tokens are
different. These are designed so that you can choose to use just
the Loot Deck from the Adventure Set (8 cards), just the Loot
Deck from the Core Set (12 cards), or combine them into a
single larger Loot Deck (20 cards). The same applies for the
Scavenge Deck and the Exploration Token stack.  

## Conquistador Heroes
The Conquistador Hero Class introduced in the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set is a Team Hero Class with 4 distinct versions or Sub-Classes
for Players to choose from - the El Capitan, Explorer, Duelist, and Soldier. All of these Sub-Classes of Conquistador have a
similar theme and share the same basic Abilities, but each has its own unique stats, equipment, and Starting Upgrades, making
them play very differently. This section provides an overview of the different Conquistador Sub-Classes, as well as the rules and
Abilities common to all Conquistador Heroes.  

### Team Hero Class - Conquistador
As a Team Hero Class, all of the Conquistador Heroes
share the same basic Abilities, including the use of Ambition
tokens. They also have access to the use of Conquistador Team
Ability cards, representing their history of training, living, and
fighting alongside one another for years.  

### Conquistador Personal Items
This set also includes a deck of Conquistador Personal
Items that are meant to be used when creating a new
Conquistador Hero.  

### Ambition (Ability Token)
Conquistador Heroes are well known for their
Ambition, both in terms of warfare and personal
glory. To represent this, Conquistador Heroes use
Ambition Tokens.  
Ambition Tokens are very similar to Grit and
can be used on any roll that Grit could be used on. Ambition
allows the Hero to Re-roll any SINGLE die they just rolled,
but adds +2 to the result of the Re-roll.  
This is incredibly powerful for when you really need to
pass a skill test, get that Critical Hit, or add just a little more
Damage to take down an Enemy. Ambition can even Re-roll
a die that has already been Re-rolled (breaking one of the
basic rules of the game)!  
However, each Hero may only use 1 Ambition per Turn for
this Re-roll ability (it may still be used for other abilities that
require Ambition in the same turn).  
Conquistador Heroes have a Max Ambition which is how
many Ambition Tokens they can hold at one time.  
Conquistadors start every Adventure with 1 Ambition as
well as their normal 1 Grit. During the Adventure, whenever
the Hero would Recover a Grit, they may choose to either
Recover a Grit as normal or Recover an Ambition. This works
whether they rolled a 1 for movement, used a Tonic Side Bag
Token, or any other method for Recovering Grit.  
Though Ambition and Grit are fairly similar, Players will
discover that each has its distinct uses, and the ability to collect
and use both gives Conquistadors a powerful advantage with
many interesting tactical choices.  
It is also important to note that Ambition cannot be used
during a Camp/Town stay, and cannot be used to cancel
Growing Dread cards like Grit can (more on that later).  

### Ruthless Warfare
All Conquistador Heroes also have the Ruthless Warfare
ability. This allows them to gain $10 and Heal either 1 Wound
or 1 Sanity Damage whenever they kill an Enemy, but also
reduces their Corruption Resistance to only 4 (normally it is
5), meaning that they are more susceptible to being corrupted
by the Darkness and gaining Mutations.  

### Team Ability Cards
Team Ability cards are unique to the Team Hero Class
and represent the fighting tactics and thematic skills of a group
of well-trained warriors who depend on one another in battle.  

### Drawing Team Ability Cards
As noted in their Abilities
box, at the start of each Adventure,
every Conquistador Hero adds 1
Conquistador Team Ability card
to the Hero Party’s Team Ability
Card Pool. These cards are intended
to encourage team play with Players
discussing how and when would be
best to use the various cards in the
Pool throughout the Adventure.  

### Playing Team Ability Cards
Team Ability cards are generally one-use bonuses for the
Adventure that are discarded after they are used. Each card says
on it when it can be played, who is affected by it, and what the
bonus is for playing the card.  
Although all of the Team Ability cards are held in a single
Pool for the Hero Party, whichever Hero added a particular
card to the Pool gets final say on how and when that card is
played.  
It is important to note that Team Ability cards are drawn
new at the start of each Adventure, and any unused Team
Ability cards still in the Pool at the end of the Adventure are
discarded.  
> Team Ability cards do NOT affect Allies such as
the Conquistador Footmen Allies that come with this
set.  

### Armor
Most Conquistador Heroes rely
on Armor to protect them from
wounds. This can come in the form
of a simple breast plate to a full suit
of Conquistador armor, like what a
Soldier would wear.  

# Mutation Chart

To roll a D36, roll two dice of different colors, where one of them is the '10's digit and the other is the '1's digit. 
For Example, if you rolled 3 and 5 the result on the chart would be 35.

D36 Mutation

11 - Chest Portal  
A hole has opened up in your chest leading to another dimension! And occasionally... stuff comes through! Anytime an 11 or 12 is rolled to Hold Back the Darkness, you must roll a D6.

On 1, 2, or 3, there is an Ambush Attack! as a Low Threat card erupts from the portal in your chest. These Enemies are all placed adjacent to you if possible, but will select targets during their first Activation.

On 4 or 5, nothing happens.

On 6, something starts itching in your portal and you reach in only to pull out a foreign object. Draw a Mine Artifact card.

12 - Tentacle Fingers
Gross! No game effect.

22 - Rock Skin
Your skin becomes hard and crusty, like it's made of rock. You are +3 Health, but -1 Move each turn (minimum of 1).  

23 - Slippery Skin
Your skin is now oily and greasy, allowing you to slide past Enemies and slip through tight spaces. You may now roll an extra die for Escape tests and choose which roll to use.

24 - Melty Skin  
Your skin has become gooey and comes off easily now. Any time you take one or more Wounds from a source, you take 1 extra Wound.

25 - Void Boils  
You are -2 Health, but +1 Max Grit.

26 - Void Infection  
Any time you pass through a Gate, you take 1 Corruption Point, ignoring Willpower.

Your tail talks to you in hushed demonic whispers, curling around to speak into your ear. Any time you take one or more Sanity Damage from a source, you take 1 extra Sanity Damage.

34 - Tail with a Mouth
Your tail nips and bites at you and any others that stray too close. Any time you or another model adjacent to you rolls a 1 on a 'To Hit' roll, that model takes 1 Wound, ignoring Defense. No XP is gained.  

35 - Tentacle Tail  
+1 Move. You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

36 - Void Plague

One of your eyes has grown over with gnarled flesh. All of your Critical Hits do 1 less Damage than normal.

You have grown a third eye that can see into the Void. Once per turn, you may spend 2 Grit to force a Threat card just drawn to be discarded and Re-drawn.

44 - Mouth Grown Over  
You can no longer speak (at least nothing beyond mumbling). All Item prices in Town cost you +$10.  

45 - Fangs
You have grown large, sharp fangs that protrude from your mouth. You gain a Bite Free Attack - Once per turn. 1 Combat, uses the D8 for Damage.  

If this Bite attack wounds a Void Enemy, you also take 1 Corruption Hit.

46 - Second Head
They say two heads are better than one...I'm not so sure. You may now use 2 Clothing - Hat Items and you are +1 Initiative. However, any time you roll a natural 6+ for movement, you lose your Activation, as your two heads are arguing over where to go next.

From now on, that Item may not be unequipped.

55 - Fused with Rock
Your skin has fused with chunks of rock, making you lumbering and slow. You are -2 Move each turn (minimum of 1), however, you also gain Armor 4+.

56 - Fused with Dark Stone
Any Dark Stone shards you currently carry have become fused to you. These cannot be sold, used, or lost in any way until this Mutation is removed, and will continue to roll for corruption at the end of each Adventure as long as they are attached to you.

New Dark Stone found and Items with Dark Stone Icons do not become fused, only the shards that you currently carry when this Mutation is rolled.  

If you aren't carrying any Dark Stone shards when this Mutation is rolled, instead, one Item you have with a Dark Stone Icon you are carrying has become fused to you. If that Item requires a Hand to use, it is considered permanently equipped.

61 - Dark Stone Allergy  
At the start of each of your Activations, take 1 Hit for every Dark Stone shard and Item with a Dark Stone Icon you are carrying (maximum of 5 Hits).

62 - Nose Fallen Off
You are in bad shape. All of your Town Location Event Chart rolls are -1 to the roll (minimum of 2).

63 - Fused Fingers
Your fingers have fused together making it impossible to do any fine manipulation. You may not use Gun Items (unless it is an Artifact card).

64 - Eye Stalks  
All of your Critical Hits are +1 Damage. You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

65 - Void Speech
You can now understand what Void creatures are saying as they hiss and growl. This is unnerving to the extreme, but can give you a leg up in a fight.

You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

Here is the travel hazard chart in markdown format:

# Travel Hazard Chart

3D6 Traveling Hazard

3 - Possession  
As you settle in for the night around the fire, there is an odd chill in the air. With a contorted face and twisted form, one of the posse is possessed by a vile demon, lashing out and speaking in tongues before regaining control! ‘You will all die before the might of the Ancient Ones...rez’chu’kau’to! Your souls will burn...Has’te’for’i...in the fires of Cynder! Beli’al will have his revenge!”

The Hero that rolled this result immediately loses D3 Sanity permanently, and must roll once on the Madness chart as a result of this horrific experience.

4 - Void Storm
A Void Storm has swept through the area, devastating the region, carrying away buildings, and mutating the livestock and people! It is not a pretty sight.  

When you arrive in Town, 2 Random Buildings have been Destroyed by the Void Storm and cannot be visited during this Town Stay. Also, every Hero gains 1 Corruption Point, ignoring Willpower, for passing though the residual energy of the storm.

5 - Living Hills
Something’s not right here, the hills surrounding the valley you are in seem to be shifting and stirring before your eyes! The road before you opens up to reveal a massive demonic maw waiting to devour you whole!  

Each Hero must make an Agility 5+ test to avoid the maw! If passed, gain 15 XP and you escape the trap. If failed, you leap aside at the last moment. Any Cart or Horse you were riding is devoured by the beast and you lose 1 Sanity permanently at the horrific sight of the creature!

6 - Flash Flood  
As you travel through the canyons, the skies open up with rain, causing a flash flood directly in your path!  

Each Hero must make a Luck 4+ test to avoid being swept away by the rushing waters. If failed, roll a D6 for each Token in your Side Bag. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, it is swept away in the torrent of water.

7 - Harried By HellBats
As the Heroes move through the countryside, dark swarms of HellBats follow overhead, swooping down to terrorize them as they go.

Each Hero must roll a D6 for every Dark Stone they are carrying (including Items with a Dark Stone Icon and Items with Dark Stone Upgrades on them). On the roll of 1, that Dark Stone shard/Item is snatched away by a HellBat and carried off into the night (discarded).

8 - Snake Oil Salesman  
You meet a traveling salesman on the road who excitedly opens up the sides of his cart and shows you his wares. He spins a good yarn about the medicinal quality of his tonics!

Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test. If passed, you recognize a scam when you see one and pass on the deal. 

If failed, you eagerly buy some of the elixirs only to discover that they are little more than flavored water and pungent herbs as the dust cloud from the salesman’s cart disappears in the distance. Lose D6x$25 and roll a D6. On the roll of 6, one of the elixirs is actually worthwhile. Gain a Tonic Token.

9 - Burning Farmstead  
Pillars of black smoke rise in the distance and as you approach you discover a farmstead in ruins and ablaze! Screams call out from the fiery inferno! 

Each Hero may decide to turn away or brave the burning building to look for survivors. If you enter the building make a Strength 5+ test to move through the flaming debris.  

If failed, you are singed by the fire and must flee the building, coughing from the thick smoke. Take D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense, that carry over to the next Adventure. If passed gain 25 XP and roll a D6 to see what you find in the fire.

D6 Roll Result  

1-4 - Gear - You find something of value. Draw a Gear card.

5 - Artifact - Perhaps this is why the creatures attacked them! Draw an Artifact card from the Mines.

6 - Survivor! - You find someone still alive in the wreckage. Packing them on your saddle, you race back to Town. If you visit the Doc's Office during this Town Stay, gain +1 Max Grit for your heroic efforts.

10 - Bridge Destroyed
The bridge across the canyon ahead has been demolished, either blown up to prevent demons from coming across, or torn apart during a skirmish! You’ll have to find another way around, which will take time...time you don’t have.

When you get to Town, the Heroes can spend no more than 2 days for their Town Stay before starting the next Adventure.

11 - Dark Dreams  
Camping along the trail, your dreams are filled with dark visions of the future and an impending dread.  

Each Hero must make a Spirit 6+ test. If passed gain 10 XP and you may Recover 1 Grit.  

If failed, you take D6 Sanity Damage, ignoring Willpower, that carry over to the next Adventure.

12 - Blighted Desert
The desert is dry and unforgiving. As you come across the first watering hole for miles, the area around it is littered with the bones of the dead! Not a good sign.  

Each Hero loses 1 Grit. If you do not have a Grit to lose, instead take D3 Wounds, ignoring Defense, that carry over to the next Adventure.

13 - Bandits!  
Waylaid by Bandits on the road, the Heroes fend off as many as they can!  

The Bandits surround each Hero individually. There are 5 Bandits per Hero and each Hero must roll a D6 to see how many of those Bandits they defeat. For every Bandit you defeat, gain 10 XP. For each of your 5 Bandits you do not defeat, lose $25, 1 Dark Stone, or 1 Gear or Artifact of your choice.

14 - Gulch Ambush
Traveling through a dusty gulch you get a bad feeling...but it’s too late! Feathered arrows whiz past your head as a savage group of Black Fang tribe Indians descend from the cliff tops, hungry for Dark Stone!

Each Hero must make an Agility 5+ or Lore 5+ test. If passed, gain 25 XP and you are able to evade the worst of the attack, escaping into the hills to meet up with the rest of the posse. 

If failed, you are knocked to the ground as the Black Fang scavenge your belongings for Dark Stone. Lose D3 Dark Stone, or one item with a Dark Stone Icon. Also, due to your bumps and bruises, you lose all Grit.

15 - Void Hound Attack  
A pack of vicious Void Hounds have been tracking your posse for days and have found the opportunity to strike!

Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test to outwit the Hounds or a Strength 5+ test to overpower them. If passed, gain 25 XP.

If failed, you are pulled from your saddle and ravaged by the creatures! Roll a D6 for every Clothing Item you have (not including your Personal Item). On the roll of 1 or 2 it is torn apart and destroyed by the savage attack.

16 - Massacred Wagon Train
You come across the twisted wreckage and broken bodies of a wagon train, torn apart by creatures!  

Each Hero can decide to pass it by without looking too close, or to sift through the gore to look for anything useful. If you search the massacre, make a Luck 5+ test. If failed, lose 1 Sanity permanently, as you are scarred by the horror of the things you find. If passed, roll a D6 to see what you find.

17 - Army Convoy
Traveling the roads, the Heroes come upon a massive US Army convoy heading toward the same Town to reinforce the outpost there.  

When the Heroes reach Town, any rolls on the Camp Site Hazard chart or the Town Event Chart are +1 to the roll.

18 - Shadowy Traveler  
You meet a dark stranger on the road one night while the rest of the posse is asleep. With a slippery voice he introduces himself as Mr. Scratch and makes you an offer that could be hard to refuse.

This result may NOT be Re-rolled or canceled. The Hero who rolled this result may either take the deal, gaining D6x100 XP and D6x$100, but if they ever roll this result again, Mr. Scratch has returned to collect his end of the bargain and takes your Hero off into the night never to be heard from again.

If you refuse the deal, make a Spirit 6+ or Cunning 6+ test to find a way out of it. If passed, gain 50 XP. If failed, gain D6+1 Corruption Points, ignoring Willpower, as Mr. Scratch disappears into the dark night.

Here are the rules for missions on pages 10 and 11 formatted in markdown:

# Missions

Missions are the backbone of Shadows of Brimstone, describing a story set up, the goals, special rules, and reward for successfully completing the Adventure. There are 12 different Missions included in a typical Core Set, and each can be played many times, as the map, cards, and story unfold differently every time you play.

## Selecting a Mission

When you are setting up for a game of Shadows of Brimstone, one of the key factors is deciding what Mission you will play. The For a Few Dark Stone More Mission is a great entry point for all groups of new Heroes starting their career of adventure.

### Rolling Randomly vs Choosing

When you are ready for your next Adventure, you can either select a Mission from the list to play, or, if you are feeling adventurous, you can roll randomly to determine your next Mission using the list below.  

If you are new to the game, it is recommended that you play though several of the Basic Missions before moving on to any of the Advanced Missions.

### Linking Missions

When playing as a campaign and keeping your Heroes from game to game, it is sometimes fun to link your Missions thematically, one after another. Though none of the Missions introduced here directly affect one another, it is easy to imagine how they might be chained together to form a narrative.

For example, if you play Exploration and succeed, you may determine that you need to Seal the Void Gate that you discovered along the way. While if you failed, you might need to form a Search Party to rescue someone carried off by the Darkness you let escape. Then if you failed to Seal the Void Gate, perhaps you should really just Blow the Mine, as it’s the only way to be sure. While if you succeeded, maybe too many creatures got through before the gate was sealed and now you have to Escape to get away alive. The narrative possibilities are endless.

## Elements of a Mission

Every Mission has a short story description as well as several features.

### Set Up 

describes the starting board arrangement and any special markers or cards the Heroes start with.

### Mission Goal 

describes what the Heroes need to do to complete the Mission.

### Special Rules

tell what extra rules are used that are specific to the Mission.

### Objectives

describes what Clue Icons are used for during the Mission (if relevant) as well as what the final Objective Room may hold. It also tells how the Mission is successfully completed by the Heroes.

### Reward 

details what bonuses the Heroes get if they successfully complete the Mission. 

### Failure

tells what happens if the Heroes lose the Mission - by all being KO’d, letting the Darkness Escape the Mines, etc.

## Mission Special Rules

Most Missions have one or more Special Rules. Often, the same Special Rule can be found in multiple different Missions. 

Special Rules marked with ‘(Objective)’ specifically relate to the Objectives of the Mission (usually only taking effect while in the final Objective Room).

Here are the rules for fixed map missions formatted in markdown:

# Fixed Map Missions

Some Missions use a fixed map rather than a randomly generated board. For these Missions, the board is created at the start of the game, as shown in the Mission’s Set Up section and map diagram.

The Map Decks are generally not used for these Missions as the entire Map is constructed during Set Up.

## Exploration Tokens

Exploration Tokens (if used) are placed on the board as shown in the map diagram. As normal, during the Room Exploration phase of the turn, if there are one or more Heroes on a Map Tile with an Exploration Token, that Token is revealed.  

During a Fight, models may not move onto a Map Tile that has an unrevealed Exploration Token.

## New Doors and Gates 

Door and Gate Icons on Exploration Tokens are not used in Fixed Map Missions, as the board is already pre-set. Any time a new Door or Gate would appear (from an Encounter card, etc.), ignore that new Door or Gate, it simply does not come into play.

## Placing Enemies

With a Fixed Map, Rooms no longer always have an obvious ‘Entrance’. Because normal Enemy placement starts at the opposite side of the Room from the ‘Entrance’, simply treat the side of the Room that the Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from as the ‘Entrance’ to that Room.  

If Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from two different directions in the same turn, roll off to see which of the two sides counts as the ‘Entrance’.


# Traveling to Town

When keeping your Heroes from game to game in a campaign, it is important to be able to resupply and get pesky Injuries, Madness, or Mutations Healed. To do this, Heroes can Travel across the countryside to reach a Frontier Town. Traveling in the shadows of the Brimstone cataclysm can be a dangerous prospect, even for the most hearty of Heroes, so beware.

## Resetting Heroes for Travel and Town

As noted in the Campaign Play section of the Rule Book, there are a series of steps the Heroes go through at the End of Each Adventure. This represents the Heroes regrouping outside the Mines.

### Mission Success or Failure

The success or failure of the previous Mission can have an impact on your Traveling or the Town you visit, as noted in the individual Mission just played. Oftentimes, failing a Mission will lead to one or more Locations in Town being Destroyed by the Darkness that you let Escape from the local mines.

### Preparing to Travel

Once the Heroes are ready to Travel, every Hero in the Posse must roll a D6. 

- A Hero that rolls a 1 or 2 on the die adds a Travel Hazard to the journey.

### Rolling for Travel Hazards

Once you have established how many Travel Hazards there will be, each Hero that added a Hazard to the trip must roll once on the Travel Hazard Chart. This can be done in any order, but each Travel Hazard roll must be completed before the next roll on the chart is made.

Note that Travel Hazards usually affect the whole group, but on occasion, they will specifically affect the Hero that triggered the Hazard/rolled the result on the chart.

The Travel Hazard Chart can be found at the back of this book, on page 56.

To roll on the chart, a Hero rolls 3D6 and adds them together. The result (between 3 and 18) is then consulted on the chart to see what the Heroes have encountered in their Travels.

### Completing Your Travels

Once all of the Travel Hazards are rolled for and resolved (and there may not have been any at all, if none of the Heroes rolled a 1 or 2 on their Travel die), the Heroes have reached their destination. Arriving at a Frontier Town, the Heroes may now interact with that Town, as described below.

## Horses and the Stage Coach

One thing that Heroes can buy while in Town is a specialty Transport, in the form of a Horse or a Stage Coach. It is assumed that every Hero has a basic Horse that lets them Travel between the mines and towns, and is left outside when delving down into the mines for an Adventure. This basic Horse does not give any bonuses and cannot be Upgraded in any way (with Dark Stone Horse Shoes, etc). Buying a specialized Horse or a Stage Coach for the Posse gives you bonuses for Traveling. These can be found at the Blacksmith in Town.

As the Stage Coach is an Item used by the whole Posse, it is limited to One per Hero Posse, as noted in its store entry. It is still purchased by a single Hero and they are considered the owner of it (or driver). The Heroes may pool their Gold, of course, to help pay for it though, as it is an expensive purchase.

As noted, every Hero is reset to full Health, full Sanity, and 1 Grit before Traveling to visit a Frontier Town.


# Visiting a Frontier Town

Once the Heroes have completed their Traveling, they reach a Frontier Town in which to buy supplies and equipment, as well as to try to Heal Injuries or Madness, or even get Corruption and Mutations removed. Of course, just because you are in a Town, it does not mean that you are safe. This is the Old West after all, and there are always dark forces at play.

The Town is represented by a small board that shows the various Locations you can visit as well as the Hotel or Camp Site you will be staying in. It also has a Town Event Track to show how long the Heroes have been in Town since the last Event occurred.

## Setting up the Town Board

The Town Board is printed on the back side of the Depth Event Chart and should be laid out at the center of the table where all Players can reach it. Place the Hero Posse marker on the ‘1’ space of the Town Event Track.

## The Town Board

### The Town Event Track

At the end of each Day in Town, the Heroes will have to make a single roll to see if a Town Event has occurred. These are usually fairly bad things and best to be avoided. The more Days that have passed since the last Town Event, the more likely it is that one will happen, so staying in Town for too long can get a bit risky. Rolling for Town Events and the Town Event Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet.

### Town Locations

There are 6 Locations that the Heroes can visit while in Town - the Doc's Office, Blacksmith, Saloon, Frontier Outpost, Church, and General Store. Each Location has Items that you can purchase as well as a unique Event Chart and specialty services. They are also each represented by a large, double-sided reference sheet that can be passed around the table as Heroes visit the different Locations.

#### Random Town Locations 

Sometimes determining a Random Town Location will be required. When this happens, simply roll a D6 and consult the numbers in the bottom corner of each of the Location spaces on the Town Board. Note that the Hotel and Camp Site are not numbered and will never be selected Randomly like this.

#### Destroyed Town Locations

Sometimes one or more Town Locations will be Destroyed. When this happens, place a marker on that Location to show that Heroes may not visit it for the rest of this Town Stay.

## A Day in Town

### The Hotel and the Camp Site

At the start of each Day in Town, each Hero must decide if they want to stay at the Hotel for the cost of $10, or if they would rather stay at the Camp Site for Free. Players should place their Hero on the Town Board in either the Hotel or Camp Site space.

Though the Camp Site does not cost Gold to stay at, it can be a little rough. Any Hero staying at the Camp Site must roll 2D6 on the Camp Site Hazard Chart to see if anything happens. This Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet. Heroes staying at the Hotel simply pay their $10 for the Day.

### Visiting a Town Location

Each Hero is allowed to visit one Town Location a Day. All of the Heroes should move their figure to the Location space on the Town Map that they wish to visit for the Day. 

#### Location Event Charts

Once all of the Heroes are at the Location they have chosen for the Day, each Hero must roll 2D6 on the Location Event Chart for the Location they are visiting. These charts can be found on the individual large reference sheets for the different Locations.

Very often a Location Event Chart result will affect all of the Heroes at that Location for the Day.

### Buying Equipment and Services

Once all of the Location Events have been rolled for and resolved, Heroes may purchase Items and pay for special services at the Location they are visiting. 

The cost for each Item or service is listed on the Location's reference sheet. When a Hero spends Gold to pay for an Item or service, the amount is deducted from that Hero's Gold total (just like in real life). Gold can sometimes be hard to come by though, so spend it wisely (again, just like in real life).

### Selling Dark Stone

Dark Stone may also be sold, but only to the Outpost Bank located at the Frontier Outpost Location. Details for this can be found on the Location's reference sheet.

### Selling Items

While in Town, a Hero may elect to sell any Item card they have for the amount of Gold listed in the bottom right corner of the card. Discard the card and add the Gold value to your Hero. This can be done at any time, regardless of where in Town you are. 

Items purchased in Town may also be sold later for 50% of the value you paid to get the Item. Services, of course, may not be sold as they were a one time event that you paid for.

#### Hero Starting Gear

Heroes may NOT trade or give their Starting Items to other Heroes, and may NOT choose to sell their Starting Items in Town.

When called on to discard an Item (by an event or Travel Hazard, for instance), a Hero may NOT choose to discard a Starting Item (though a Starting Item MAY be lost when discarding a ‘Random Item’).

A Starting Item MAY be discarded voluntarily, to make room for carrying other Items.

Because Starting Gear cards are a fundamental part of every Hero Class, if a Hero's Starting Item has been lost/discarded, they MAY purchase a replacement of it in Town, at any time (no specific Location is required), for the Gold Value listed on that Item. If there is no Gold Value listed, the Hero may acquire a replacement for free.

### End of the Day 

Once all of the Heroes have finished their Location visit, the Day ends and the Heroes must roll to see if a Town Event occurs. If it does, the Town Event must be resolved and affects all Heroes in Town. If not, then the Day ends quietly with a nice sunset over the mountains.

Then, a new Day begins and the process is repeated.

### Leaving Town

Any Heroes that do not want to spend any more time in Town may elect to Leave Town at the end of a Day, after the Town Event is rolled for and resolved. Once a Hero Leaves Town, they may not return until after the next Adventure, but are no longer affected by any Town Events that may occur.


# Hero Classes and Leveling Up
There are several different Hero Classes that players can choose from in Shadows of Brimstone, each with their own style of play and unique feel. Keeping your Hero from game to game allows them to progress in Hero Level, gaining new abilities and collecting all manner of Gear and Artifacts along the way to help in their Adventures against tougher and tougher Enemies.

Once your Hero has collected enough XP, you can spend it to go up to the next Hero Level. This will usually grant you more Health/Sanity, Skill boosts, and even a new Ability unique to your Hero Class.

### Spending XP to Level Up
The amount of XP required to ‘Level Up’ to the next Hero Level is shown on the chart below.

### Choosing an Upgrade Chart Ability
Every Hero Class also has an Upgrade Chart that acts as a skill tree of new abilities, unique to your Hero Class. Each time you Level Up, you may choose one new Ability from your Upgrade Chart.

The chart has four different vertical Tracks that run top to bottom and are themed for a particular aspect of that Hero Class. When choosing a new Ability, you may pick from any of the four Tracks, but you must take the first Ability in that Track that you do not already have. In other words, you must have the first tier Ability in a Track before you can take the second tier ability below it, etc. Note that as the Hero Level cap is 8, a Hero will not be able to get the fourth tier ability in more than one of the different Tracks, so choose wisely as you Level Up.

### Mark Down Your New Level
Once you have spent the required XP to Level Up, make a note of your new Hero Level to keep track of where you are.

### Hero Level Cap
Heroes max out at Level 8. Though you can continue to acquire XP and keep Adventuring, you may not Level Up beyond Hero Level 8 (at least not yet).

### Leveling Up Mid-Game
As soon as a Hero has enough XP, they may spend that XP to Level Up. This may even be done during an Adventure! A Hero may Level Up at the start of a Game Turn by spending the appropriate amount of XP. That Hero immediately Fully Heals their Health and Sanity, and Recovers 1 Grit. They may then immediately gain the benefits of Leveling Up as noted below.

It is important to note that XP is actually spent to Level Up, removing the XP from your Hero’s XP total.

Just like each individual Hero has a Hero Level, the group as a whole has a Hero Posse Level. The Hero Posse Level is equal to the highest Level Hero currently in the group, so a group with a Level 2 Hero, two Level 3 Heroes, and a Level 4 Hero would be Hero Posse Level 4.

The Hero Posse Level is set at the start of each Adventure and allows for different Heroes to come and go from the group from game to game. Once an Adventure starts, the Hero Posse Level does NOT change, even if one or more Heroes Level Up mid-game.

### Tougher Monsters
As the Heroes go up in Level, the Enemies that you fight will also naturally get more difficult. All of the Enemies in an Adventure get a Bonus based on the Hero Posse Level at the start of that Adventure as follows:

| Posse Level | Enemy Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No Bonus |
| 2 | No Bonus |
| 3 | 1 Elite Ability |
| 4 | 2 Elite Abilities |
| 5 | Brutal Side of Enemies |
| 6 | Brutal Side of Enemies |
| 7 | Brutal + 1 Elite Ability |
| 8 | Brutal + 2 Elite Abilities |

Remember also that Elite Enemies are +5XP for each Elite Ability they have. Brutal Enemies are worth more XP as listed on their sheet.

A Hero that has enough XP to Level Up MUST do so before the next Adventure begins.

### Roll for Free Upgrade Bonus
Each Hero Class has a free Upgrade Bonus Chart. Whenever your Hero Levels Up, you get to roll 2D6 on the Chart to determine your random bonus. This is in addition to choosing a new Ability for your Hero.

|Hero Level|XP Cost|
|---|---|
|1|Start|
|2|500|
|3|1,000|
|4|2,000|
|5|3,000|
|6|4,500|
|7|6,000|
|8|8,000|

# Shadows of Brimstone - Lore Reference
This document is a reference of the lore of the Shadows of Brimstone setting. Understanding more about the myriad worlds, creatures, factions, events, characters, cultures, artifacts and relationships of Shadows of Brimstone is the key to creating fun and exciting content for the game including:

- Missions
- Narrative Events
- Places
- Quests
- Campaigns

This reference collects information from as many official sources as possible, but may also include unofficial lore created by fans of the game. This reference should therefore **not** be considered official canon approved by Flying Frog Productions.  

## Dark Stone
Dark Stone is perhaps the most important narrative concept to understand the many worlds of Shadows of Brimstone. Dark Stone is a mysterious black rock mineral, appearing purple when held in the light. The origins of Dark Stone is not known. Sometimes, a vein of Dark Stone is discovered deep within the ground when prospectors are mining for other valuable ores such as copper and gold. Other times, Dark Stone comes crashing into the atmosphere as a meteorite, breaking up in the sky and scattering across the land.  

Dark Stone is the most valuable substance in Shadows of Brimstone. It can be used as an energy source to power industry, rail cars, great machines, and even starships. It can be shaped and molded into material such as arrowheads, blade tips, armored plating, or simply worn as jewelry. Blacksmiths and other craftesmen have taken to modifying weapons, trinkets, and other equipment with Dark Stone for enhanced effects. Soothsayers, witches, shamans, and monks use the black rock in their rituals, spells, tonics and cure-alls. The versatility of Dark Stone seems to be virtually unlimited.  

The value of Dark Stone can be seen in how common it is for various cultures and civilizations across time and space to use Dark Stone as a type of currency when bartering and trading. But Dark Stone is every bit as dangerous as it is valuable.  

While normal people can't sense it, Dark Stone emits a kind of radiation colloqually referred to as "corruption". Nobody knows why, but prolonged exposure to the substance in high enough densities often cause organic life to mutate. These mutations vary greatly from arms and legs turning into tentacles, forked tongues, grown over eyes, fangs, and hardened skin. Unique and strange mutations are discovered all the time. Dark Stone seems to be capable of mutating just about any life form, not just humans. It has been known to "corrupt" all manner of flora and fauna.  

Dark Stone also becomes unstable when stored in dense concentrations. This has been known to cause occasional explosions and sometimes cause people to suffer strange and terrifying hallucinations. Some are even driven to complete madness by the corrupting influence of Dark Stone. This has always made Dark Stone tricky to store and transpored for those wanted to grow rich off its great bounty, but greed often wins over and the danger is ignored.  

Perhaps the most interesting effect of Dark Stone in dense concentrations is to occasionally tear a hole in the very fabric of reality, creating a gateway between worlds across time, space, and even dimensions. These tears are sometimes fleeting, such that a few strange and terrifying creatures make it through the crack in reality before it closes, able to wreak havoc on those unprepared on the other side. Other times, a more stable Gate is formed, allowing travel to and from two distinct worlds for anyone brave enough to cross over. But one never knows how long each Gate will remain stable.  

As a narrative element, Dark Stone is central to many stories in Shadows of Brimstone. Greed for Dark Stone creates conflict among those who want it. The destruction caused by Dark Stone calls to would be Heroes and Adventurers willing to help. The corrupting influence of Dark Stone is at the core of many of the dangerous foes encountered by adventurers. But Dark Stone is also a reward, able to be sold, used to craft powerful weapons and gear, and opens Gates to new worlds and frontiers to explore.  

## Gates
In the context of Shadows of Brimstone, Gates are portals that bridge two worlds. Not much is known about how to create or control them, or how long they remain stable. It is widely known that Gates seem to be created by concentrations of Dark Stone. Gates don't always form where Dark Stone is found, but when they do, there is always Dark Stone nearby. That there is a connection between the two phenomena is clear.  

It's hard to tell how long a Gate will remain stable. It could be hours, days, or weeks. But they do seem to eventually close again.  

There is no telling where the other end of a Gate will take you until you are close enough to peer through to the other side. Sometimes, people try and create gates themselves by concentrating Dark Stone and risking explosions or awful mutations. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, but so far, nobody has found a way to force a Gate to open to a specific world, time, or dimension.  

The more Gates appear, the bigger reality seems to get. While still quite a spectacle, it's not impossible to come across an adventurous Japanese samurai from the feudal era of Japan's history wandering back alleys of an 1850's American frontier town in the Wild West. Sometimes, even aliens from other worlds can be found around the poker table of a frontier western saloon. It seems like a Gate could lead almost anywhere or any time, even to other dimensions like Hell itself!  

Gates are another central narrative element and often important features of quests, missions, and exciting encounters. They provide endless variety and opportunity to continue expanding the setting of Shadows of Brimstone into completely new places to keep the stories and adventures feeling fresh.  

## Worlds
Since Dark Stone causes tears in the fabric of reality and sometimes bridges two realites together through a gate, there are limitless possibilities when it comes to to the variety of settings that adventurers can explore when stepping through a gate to another world.  

Within the game rules, each core set of the game (a "core set" provides all of the required minimum rules and components to play Shadows of Brimstone in a single box which can then be mixed with the content sold in other boxes such as expansions and other core sets.) has a default world setting which is native to the Heroes that come as part of the core set. For example, the Forbidden Fortress core set contains Heroes native to the high fantasy Feudal Japan setting and world. The world that is native to the Heroes can be thought of as the "home" or "main" world for the game, even though the rule books don't have a specific word for that in game terms.  

All other worlds that are **not** native to the Heroes are considered to be an "OtherWorld". Each core set comes with a single OtherWorld for the starting Heroes to explore. Each OtherWorld is a unique setting that might take place in a different time period, on a different planet, or even a different dimension or reality! In addition, each OtherWorld setting has a variety of Map Tiles, Artifacts, Encounters, and Enemies that are designed to be "native" to the OtherWorld, making each OtherWorld setting feel unique from the others during an adventure.  

Most OtherWorld settings feature some kind of Environment rule which is always in effect while the Heroes are located in the OtherWorld. These could be anything from unique weather game effects to anything else that makes good thematic use of the setting.  

Additional OtherWorlds can be purchased as part of Deluxe Expansions to increase the variety of OtherWorld settings that Heroes can explore on their adventure.  

Visiting an OtherWorld can happen either randomly or by design. During an adventure in the "main" world native to the Heroes, there is a random possiblity in most missions for a gate to an OtherWorld to spawn as the Heroes explore the map tiles. When a Gate is spawned, a deck of Environment cards matching each OtherWorld is shuffled and drawn randomly to see where the Gate leads. Players are of course free to pick a specific world that they want to visit instead, and some missions may specify that all Gates lead to a specific OtherWorld as part of their design.  

The rest this section provides narrative descriptions of each world setting, including all the "native" worlds. It is perfectly viable for fans to create new OtherWorld locations to visit, but this will typically require a lot of work due to the need for a lot of content that needs to be created for adding a new world, such as custom map tiles and cards, encounters, artifacts, a depth event chart unique to the world, and environment rule for the world, and several enemies to encounter which are native to the world. Of course, generative AI may be able to greatly assist fans in reducing the amount of effort needed to create all of the necessary content for adding new worlds to the game!

### Sunken City of Pharrox
Once a powerful kingdom of the ancient world, ruled by a dynasty of ruthless vampires, the island city of Pharrox Atlantea was destroyed, sinking to the cold depths of the sea. For millennia it was left undisturbed and forgotten to history; its ancient inhabitants dormant in a twilight slumber. Now, its shimmering gateways have been activated once again by those seeking its lost knowledge and treasures. But all they will find... are the Terrors of the Deep!  

### Valley of the Serpent Kings
It is the Age of Exploration, and Spanish voyages set out across
the vast oceans, making landfall on the sandy shores of the New
World. But these jungle islands and rocky coasts hold more than
new trade opportunities and rumored riches. The local people tell
tales of a magical Dark Stone found in the volcanic mountains, and
strange shimmering gateways that lead to another world. A world
ruled by a ruthless civilization of cold blooded Serpentmen that
have been raiding their villages since the black rock was discovered.
Constructing stone forts to defend against these strange creatures, the
Conquistadors sent word back to Spain for reinforcements. But they
did not know the Darkness that had already begun to spread within.
Initially at odds with the nearby Aztec Empire, who had already
been at war with the Serpentmen for some time, it soon became clear
that if humanity had any chance of survival, the Conquistadors and
Aztecs would need to work together to hold back this Darkness from
spreading out across the world.  

Where most of Jargono is
covered in a dense canopy of
jungle swamps, the Valley of
the Serpent Kings is a vast
stretch of marshlands
and rivers, nestled
between winding
mountainous
ridges. Ruled
over by the
warring
tribes of the
Serpentmen
and their
powerful Kings,
the valley is dotted with
stepped pyramids, sacred
temple courtyards, and golden cities of untold riches and
danger.  


## Characters

## Hero Classes
These Hero Class descriptions help flesh out a better narrative picture of their roles within the setting of Shadows of Brimstone.  
### Valkyrie Shield Maiden
Riding down from the sky on a winged steed, the death dealing Valkyrie is a warrior maiden in the service of Odin himself, the god of war! Though their numbers are few next to the hordes of beasts and demons that have overrun the land now tainted by the void energies of the Dark Stone, the Valkyries have come to help defend the lands of mortal men from the encroaching Darkness.  

## Team Heroes
Team Heroes are additional Hero Classes that can be found in various Adventure Set and Expansion products. They function just like normal Hero classes, but are narratively designed to work together as a team. Being thematically part of a team, they likely have a shared overlapping history for role playing purposes. 

## Team Heroes - Conquistadors

### El Capitan
A leader of the
expedition, El Capitan is
a skilled swordsman and
explorer of noble lineage.
His armor and helmet are
adorned with gold filigree
and a striking feather
plume, indicative of his
suave nature and regal
stature.  

**Armor and Sword**  
El Capitan’s Ornate
Helmet and Conquistador
Armor grant him a built
in extra Armor 5+ save
against each individual
Wound he might take, as
well as increasing his ability to hold and use Ambition. Armed
with a Spanish Sword, El Capitan is also skilled with a blade,
making his Critical Hits deadly with a side step and a thrust.  

**Ambitious Leader**  
Ruthless and confident, El Capitan is the military leader of
the group. Selecting the Boundless Ambition Starting Upgrade
lets him make full use of his Ambition, with a chance to
Recover it whenever he kills a foe, and letting him spend up
to 2 Ambition per turn for Re-rolls. The Expedition Leader
Upgrade allows El Capitan to bring an extra Team Ability card
to each Adventure, and to use his experience and Battle Plans
to help his fellow explorers Re-roll a To Hit or Defense die
while nearby.  

### Explorer
The Explorer is an
expert at guiding the
expedition, seeking out the
objectives and treasures the
party is searching for.  

**Versatile Gear**
The Explorer’s Armor
is not as heavy or robust
as that of the Soldier, but
it still grants an Armor 6+
save against Wounds he
would take. In addition,
the Morion Helmet helps
by letting him Re-roll a
single Armor save or a
single die on a Skill test
once per turn. Topped off
with a Spanish Sword for
doing extra damage on
Critical Hits makes the Explorer a good combat fighter as well.  

**In Search of Discovery**  
Using the Thirst for Discovery Starting Upgrade, the
Explorer can move faster and gains extra XP for Looking
Through Doors and Scavenging the area. It also grants him
bonus Grit for exploring new Map Tiles. The Dark Stone
Hunter Upgrade instead focuses on collecting the magical
black rock. It lets the Explorer carry Dark Stone without being
corrupted by it, and gives him the ability to use Dark Stone to
cancel Darkness cards during the Adventure.  

### Duelist
A nimble master of
fencing, the Duelist relies
on speed and her skill
with the blade to carry the
day. Forgoing the heavy
armor of her teammates,
she lunges and thrusts
to skewer her foes, while
parrying their strikes away.  

**Dueling Blades**  
The Dueling Blades
of the Duelist are quite
versatile and can be
equipped as either singlehanded
or two-handed.
While just using one
Hand Slot, they let you
force an adjacent Enemy
to Re-roll one of their To
Hit rolls once per turn.
This allows you to protect yourself, or others that are nearby.
While equipped in both of your Hand Slots, it also grants you
+1 Combat, giving an extra die for your Melee Attack. This
versatility means that the Dueling Blades are great to use on
their own, but can be easily paired with another weapon you
find along the way.  

**Master of Death**  
The Duelist’s Starting Upgrade options help her to deal
out death, or avoid it altogether. With Dance of Death, she
gets to roll an extra Combat die whenever she rolls a Critical
Hit. This can turn a fairly basic Attack into a whirlwind of
destruction. With Laughs at Death, she gets to use a D8 for a
single Defense roll per turn (even getting to roll against a Hit
that would ignore Defense), and if she needs to use a Revive
Token, she has a great chance of not having to discard it.  

### Soldier
A stern veteran of
warfare in Europe, the
Soldier is a hardened
warrior. He is heavily
armored and equipped
for combat, wading into
hordes of Enemies that
would crush a less seasoned
fighter.  

**Heavy Crossbow**  
The Soldier is armed
with a heavy Crossbow to
punch through even the
toughest defenses of his
opponents. The Crossbow
uses the D8 To Hit, giving
him much better odds of
getting Critical Hits. At the
same time, he is the toughest of the group, with a high Health
and heavy Conquistador Armor granting him an extra Armor
5+ save against incoming Wounds.  

**Veteran Mercenary**  
Sanity from already experiencing the horrors of war up
close, as well as a Grizzled Scowl letting him Re-roll one of his
To Hit rolls each turn for free. The Mercenary Upgrade instead
focuses on doubling the Gold you collect just for killing each
Enemy, and giving you Grit back in a more consistent flow
(which of course can also be taken as Ambition).

### Trederran Strike Team
The Trederran Strike Team is an elite fighting squad of alien Special Forces soldiers, deployed on dangerous missions by the High Command of their Trederran Nation.  

This Expansion includes the new Trederran Team Heroes, with 4 unique types of Trederrans to play as - the Sergeant, leading the team with grim determination, the Legionnaire, an elite soldier pulled from the front lines, the Specialist, a master in using the various Weapons of War, and the Engineer, a demolitions and tech expert. This allows players to take on the role of a team of alien Anti-Heroes for the first time.  

The Trederran Strike Team Expansion includes the Trederran Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – the Sergeant, Legionnaire, Engineer, and Specialist.  

**Sergeant** – A veteran of many campaigns, the Sergeant is a grizzled soldier who charges into the fray, leading his men on deadly missions. Armed with a Sergeant’s Sabre and Master Forged Trench Pistol, he closes with deadly speed to engage his foes up close and personal, while giving Commands to his unit.  

**Legionnaire** – Pulled from the Trenches to go on special operations as part of the Strike Team, the Legionnaire is the best at what he does. Equipped with the full trench gear, Shatter Grenades, and weaponry of a front lines soldier, he is a crack shot, armed to the teeth!  

**Engineer** – The Engineer is a master of tech and demolitions, brandishing an Arc Light Pistol and using the latest in Trederran technology with an array of Dark Stone powered gadgets. Utilizing stealth over sheer force, the Engineer helps the team to overcome obstacles, locate their objectives, and is the best equipped to set up toxic gas generators and other nefarious devices.   

**Specialist** – Heavily armored and trained in the use of a variety of powerful Weapons of War, the Specialist can select a different Special Weapon at the start of each Adventure, to suit the needs of the mission. Whether wielding a Grenade Launcher, a Dragon Fire Thrower, a Light Machine Gun, or even a brutal Chain-Blade, the Specialist adds extra punch to the Strike Team’s arsenal.   

### Viking Team Heroes
The Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set includes the Viking Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – the Jarl chieftain, Huscarl honor guard, Raider, and Berserker.  

**Jarl** – A Leader of the clan, the Jarl is a brutal and stubborn warrior. Armed with a two-handed War Axe and a heavy coat of Mail Armor, he splits his foes in half with deadly force, boosting his Rage by rolling Critical Hits or shrugging off damage with his chainmail armor.  

**Huscarl** – One of the clan’s distinguished honor guard, the Huscarl carries a hefty Shield and Norse Sword, crafted to cut down the savage Beasts and Demons of the north. She is also an expert with the Viking Bow, used to pick off Enemies at a distance and take quick shots at the beginning of a skirmish, before she charges into the fray.  

**Raider** – The most classic Viking, a Raider is a warrior of few words, most often uttered as a Battle Roar before leaping into combat. Armed with Heavy Furs, a Raider’s Helmet, Shield, and Viking Axe, the Raider hacks Enemies apart, shrugging off hordes of foes as he goes.  

**Berserker** – Whipped into a frenzy of battle, the Berserker is a madman. Swinging two lethal axes, and fighting bare-chested, but for a wolf pelt slung over his shoulders, the Berserker unleashes his Rage in a swirling melee of death and destruction. Though not the most accurate or defensive of fighters, he makes up for it with a dizzying flurry of blows!  

### Conquistadors
The Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set includes the Conquistador Team Hero Class, with 4 different Sub-Class specialties to play – El Capitan, the Explorer, Duelist, and Soldier.  

**El Capitan** – Leading the way, El Capitan is guided by his Boundless Ambition. Adorned in finely-crafted armor and a plumed helmet, he stands at the head of the expedition, slicing down any foes that stand in his way with an armored fist and his ruthless Steel Sword.  

**Explorer** – The quintessential Spanish Conquistador, the Explorer wears a classic breast plate and Morion Helmet, and is armed with a sword of finest Spanish steel. He specializes in helping the group to pick their way through the jungles and swamps, seeking out vast treasures and avoiding traps set by the villainous Serpentmen that stalk the Valley.  

**Duelist** – A lightly armored fighter, the Duelist prefers speed and agility over brute strength. She is armed with a set of finely crafted Dueling Blades that slice through the air with deadly accuracy, easily parting her opponents from their limbs. The Duelist’s fighting style is more akin to an artful dance of death.  

**Soldier** – Stalwart and stubborn, the Conquistador Soldier is heavily armored, from head to toe, carrying a powerful Crossbow to skewer his foes. A veteran fighter, trained on the battlefields of Europe for over a decade, the Soldier has joined the Expedition to seek out a fortune of his own.  
### Cursed Eternal
One of the twelve crew of Ponce De Leon that explored the wilds to discover the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternals succeeded in their quest for immortality, but at a grim cost. By drinking the Fountain's water, they were granted eternal life, but live out their days in a constant state of withering away, gaunt and pale. Only by cutting down Enemies with his tainted Ghost Blade, and stealing the life essence from his foes, can the Cursed Eternal hold his deterioration at bay.  

## Enemies & Factions
While most factions and creatures are usually treated as dangerous Enemies in the game, sometimes players are able to play as characters belonging to a faction they are normally enemies with, such as Trederrans. Because of this, "Factions and Creatures" is used as the title for this section instead of "Enemies". There is always the possibility for narrative situations in which these characters take roles such as NPC's and companions instead of enemies during an adventure.  

Each enemy design is often narratively connected and native to one of the world settings in Shadows of Brimstone. Of course, due to Gates creating temporary bridges between two worlds, it is possible to encounter enemies that are not native to the world in which the Heroes find themselves exploring. But in general, encountering non-native enemies should be more rare in order to make each world setting feel more narratively cohesive. There are some enemies, such as the Shikari Nomad's, which are specifically designed as enemies that travel through Gates to worlds that are not native to themselves as part of their narrative design.  

### Enemies - Various
**Bastet Assassins**  
Using the shadows to move quickly, unseen and silent, the Bastet Assassins are nimble warriors of the Goddess Bastet. They strike without warning and fade back into the darkness with a whispering purr.  

The Bastet Assassins have a Supernatural Prowess to fade from shadow to shadow, repositioning themselves to the best advantage against the Heroes. With a Rapid Strike, they slice and stab their target with countless cuts, ducking and weaving their way through a fight.  

**Hell Train Void Conductor**  
Tainted by the corruption of the Darkness, the Void Conductor of the Hell Train rings his ominous bell to shift reality around him, tearing open rifts into the Void and spreading terror through the cursed Train!

The Void Conductor is a Hell Train-themed Mini Boss that can buff other Enemies around him and Shift Reality to his will, opening tears in space to unleash fierce creatures from the Void. His body is twisted and in a constant state of mutation and flux, making him a difficult foe to lock down.  

**Hell Bear**  
Bursting through the snowy trees, the mammoth Hell Bear is a terrifying enemy to behold. Towering over the Heroes, this mutated behemoth is tainted by the Darkness and enraged by the power of the Hellborn! Often preceded by menacing roars that echo through the icy crags and across the frozen wastes, the Hell Bears of the Norse Lands are not subtle in their hunting methods.   

The Rage of the Hell Bear is limitless, as it shreds anything within the reach of its massive jaws and powerful clawed arms. Though they often travel on their own, Hell Bears are also renowned for hunting in packs. While one of these wild creatures can be an unstoppable force, an encounter with a pack of them is rarely recounted, as there are few that live long enough to tell the tale.  

The Hell Bear is an XL Beast that can be found on regular Threats (LOW, MED, and HIGH), though often Heavily Mutated when traveling as a pack. A full-strength pack can be encountered as an EPIC Threat. They also appear in the Targa Plateau OtherWorld in the form of the savage Nomadic Yeti.  

Though their heavily mutated form prevents their Health from getting too high, the Hell Bear's Monstrous Rage allows them to be constantly Healing Damage for every Hit assigned to them! This includes Hits that do no Damage, so your Attacks may end up Healing the creature even if they can't break through its Defense.  

With its Ferocious Attack, the Hell Bear always Re-targets each turn, moving to get next to as many Heroes as possible, then making its full Attack against every adjacent Hero. This combined with its Terrifying Claws that ignore Defense on To Hit rolls of 6+, make Hell Bears dangerous foes to face. In addition, their Claws also give Hell Bear Combat Hits an extra Damage bonus if the Hero rolls a natural 1 on their Defense roll for that Hit, as the Hero has left themselves open to a more savage Attack from the creature.  

One XL Hell Bear is dangerous, but a pack of up to 3 Hell Bears at a time can be downright devastating to a Hero Party. One more reason that the Norse Lands are not to be traveled lightly.  

**Shadow Lurker**  
Shifting through the darkness that spreads across all worlds, the Shadow Lurkers are ancient demons of the Void. They are formless, malign entities that watch from the shadows, hungering to feed on the memories and experiences of their victims, as well as the most wretched of human emotions. Jealousy, lust, wrath; but above all...greed. They are drawn to the history and power of relics, stalking those that collect and carry artifacts from world to world. These creatures take on a monstrous humanoid form to erupt from the Darkness, with quivering cheeks and a hate beyond time as they relentlessly terrorize their prey, lashing out with long, clawed fingers and viciously jagged teeth. Shadow Lurkers are nightmares made manifest.  

**Feathered Serpents**  
On feathered wings, the Serpents of Kotak descend from the heavens to hiss and strike at those who would dare intrude on the temples dedicated to their ancient master.  With long, needle-like fangs, the Feathered Serpents deliver a powerful venom to their foes, piercing armor and flesh alike.  Highly agile, the winged serpents dart from target-to-target, lashing out with their tails and using their venomous bite to strike with deadly accuracy.  But perhaps their most dangerous asset is the protection afforded to them by Kotak himself; a powerful death ward that can mend even the most grievous of wounds with the cosmic magik of the Ancients.  

**Fenris Wolves**  
Howling echoes through the snow-capped forests, and the trees rustle in the shadowed crags of the frozen North. Great beasts stalk the mountain passes, and many a traveler and trader has gone missing in these icy hills. Smashed carts and blood-soaked snow are often all that remains after a pack of ravenous Fenris Wolves strikes their prey.  

Standing nearly 8 feet tall, a Fenris Wolf is a nightmare of myth and legend in the North. With great muscular shoulders and powerful jaws that can snap tree trunks like twigs, the Fenris Wolves hunt in packs, striking from the shadows to feed their supernatural hunger for flesh. Even the gods tremble with fear at the largest and most savage of these creatures. The blood of Fenrir, the greatest of their kind, courses through their veins, while the blood of their foes drips from their fangs.  

**Draugar**  
Another fearsome Enemy found in the frozen wastes of the Norse Lands are the Draugar. Fallen warriors corrupted by the Darkness, the Draugar rise back up from their rocky graves and snow covered battlefields to hunt down and drain the essence of the living! Still carrying their rusty weapons and broken shields, and adorned in tattered armor and rotting clothes, these Undead Vikings are mere husks of their former selves.  

It is said that the Draugar feed on the Darkness within, the evil that corrupts the hearts of mortal men, leaching the vitality and essence from all living things that lie in their path. Plants wilt and shrivel to a rotted brown as they pass by, while even the air around them grows icy cold and carries the stench of eternal despair.  

**Thunderforged Titan**  
Forged with roaring thunder and animated by arcing lightning bound within an armored metal shell, these titanic behemoths are the ultimate warriors of Hel, goddess of death. Bursting through the ancient gates of the Underworld, the towering titans emerge from the cold depths of Niflheim to sow chaos and devastation upon the worlds of men and gods alike! Emblazoned with the fiery runes of Muspelheim by the demon-giant Surtr, the Thunderforged Titans leave a trail of flames and erupting magma in their wake as they march to war, and the end of all things... Ragnarok!  

**Lumia Vampires**  
These dark broods travel by night and feed on the living!  They are an ancient and nomadic band of female Vampires of the old world!  Beautiful and haunting, the Lumia Vampires are deadly hunters - with fangs and claws, and an insatiable thirst for blood! Weaving sinister curses and hexing their prey, only the strongest willed Heroes can stand in the face of these terrifying succubi. Their undead flesh can regrow even the most brutal of wounds, mending before your eyes as they rise back up with a renewed hunger to spread their haunting curse with each Vampiric Bite.  

**Feljeagor Slayers**  
Forged in the underworld from thunder and lightning, the Feljeagors are animated suits of meteoric armor made for one purpose...to bring about the end times, Ragnarok! Crackling with dark energy, these automaton warriors march to war, brandishing their Slayer Axes to smite gods and men alike, while the deafening roar of their Fel Horns echo through the mountains, whipping their legions into a frenzy of rage.  

**Drowned Dead**  
One of the main Enemies that Conquistador Heroes will face in the Valley of the Serpent Kings Brimstone Adventures Set are the ghastly and terrifying Drowned Dead that roam the halls of the Spanish Forts! These shambling horrors were once fellow Conquistadors; explorers that came before and have fallen into darkness. Their Corroded Armor hangs loose on their rotten bodies, dripping water and trailing shreds of seaweed and vines pulled from the swamps as they clawed their way back out of the jungle. Wielding Cursed Blades that spread fear and corruption, the Drowned Dead are an Endless Horde, crawling out of the shadows to overwhelm the living!  
Tainted by the Darkness,
the Drowned Dead are Spanish
explorers from previous expeditions
that have been corrupted, rising
from their watery graves for
revenge upon the living.  


**Trolls**  
One of the main Enemies that Viking Heroes will face in the Gates of Valhalla Brimstone Adventures Set are the monstrous and hateful Trolls of the Norse Lands! These hulking, Mythic Beasts live in the wild lands of the north, attacking nearby villages and ambushing unwary travelers to feed on. With jagged claws and a satchel of hefty boulders to throw, Trolls spread fear throughout the dark forests and icy crags they call home. Able to Regenerate even the most gruesome injuries, an angry Troll can be a terrifying foe to face, let alone a group of them.  

**Deep Stalkers**  
Deep Stalkers are terrifying fish-men, emerging from the deep dark below the churning surface of the sea! With both gills and lungs, these slimy fiends are equally at home in water or on land. They climb aboard ships that stray into their domain, attacking the crew and stealing their supplies (as well as kidnapping the occasional crewman for their dark feedings).  

**Leviathan Tentacles**  
Leviathan Tentacles are the long, squid-like tentacles of a massive Leviathan, submerged below the surface of the water. These long Tentacles rise up from the deep to attack Heroes at sea, or those that linger too close to the coastlines.  

**Gremians**  
One of the new enemies featured in the Gates of Valhalla Shadows of Brimstone Adventures set, is the Gremians!  The set contains 12 of these small impish little demons, and they are nasty little guys!  This is a closer look at the miniature sculpt.  We named these guys for the Olde English word Gremian, which later evolved into the word Gremlin.  But any way you spell or pronounce it, they mean business.  Specifically, the business of trouble-making!  Each Gremian in Gates of Valhalla is armed with a sturdy little knife to poke, stick, and stab at heroes, and little clawed fingers and toes that can scratch at any heroes who cross paths with them!   

Gremians can be found to infest many different Worlds, whether hiding among the snow-covered trees of the Norse Lands, or lurking in the shadowy corners and dark halls of the ancient city of the Targa Plateau.  
### Faction: Setaris Kitewings

**Setaris Ravagers**  
The Setaris Kitewings are a ruthless alien civilization, bent on conquest and devastation. A reptilian species with large, leathery wings, they descend from above to rain death upon their foes. Often acting in small bands of space pirates known as Ravager Enclaves, these cunning raiders have mastered Hit-and-Run attacks to strike quickly and without warning. Not known for taking prisoners, it is said that the Setaris have a habit of feeding on the dead.  

The Setaris Kitewings were first introduced in the Conquest of Planet Earth board game as one of the many Alien Races that players could control in their bid to conquer 1950's Earth. A reptilian species, the Setaris soar through the sky with their swooping wings and lashing tails, chittering and cawing to each other through their long vicious beaks filled with razor sharp teeth. But do not let their savage and monstrous demeanor fool you; they are an advanced civilization, ruthless in their desire for conquest, wielding dangerous technologies and armed with powerful weapons.  

Though not particularly tough, the Setaris Ravagers can strike fast and hard, blasting the Heroes with their Setaris Laser Rifles before closing in to scratch and claw with their talons. These sinister Enemies use the rules for Snap Fire,  giving them the opportunity to make a free Ranged Attack each turn before closing in on the Heroes to use their Combat; then falling back to a distance to be ready to start the process again the following turn. And, with their Masters of Snap Fire ability, the Ravagers are even harder to pin down than other Enemies that use Snap Fire. They are also quite fast as they fly through the air, evading damage with their Agile Dodge.  

As Alien pirates, enclaves of Setaris Ravagers can be found across the  galaxy, looting and pillaging travelers and settlements, then disappearing as quickly as they arrived. To represent this, the Setaris  Ravagers Enemy Pack includes OtherWorld Threat Cards for encountering them in the Swamps of Jargono, Blasted Wastes, the Targa Plateau, and the Derelict Ship, as well as the standard Threat cards for Low, Med, and High threats.  
### Faction: The Trun

**Trun Outcasts**  
Part of a brutish warrior race of reptilian soldiers, the Trun tower over humans, standing around 10' tall. With rippling muscles and a thick scaled hide, the Trun are the ultimate hunters in the galaxy, using brutal weapons and wearing heavy armor plating. They seek out deadly prey to test their skills, living and fighting in tribes of armored warriors.  

Sometimes, when a member of a Trun hunting pack becomes disgraced or fails in a critical hunt, they are banished from the tribe, an outcast to their people. These warriors often seek out a glorious death in combat or travel great distances to stalk the deadliest prey alive. But some... some choose to take on a new life. A life of adventure...danger...the life of a Hero! Or maybe just a mercenary. If the pay is high and the chance of glorious death is higher, a Trun Outcast can rarely say no.  

### Faction: The Scafford Gang

The Scafford Gang are the most notorious mutant outlaws in the Southwest! Making their hideouts in the old caves and mines around the ruins of Brimstone, they have becoming grossly mutated by the cursed radiation of the Dark Stone. As their infamy grows, so too do their ranks, welcoming in any fellow mutants that have been ousted by the locals or that are just looking to make a dishonest buck!  

Lead by Colonel Scafford and his original gang of confederates (including his miscreant sons), the Scafford Gang mostly loots travelers on the road, knocks over frontier town banks, and raids caravans for their gold and precious Dark Stone cargo. But when it comes to bigger heists, the Colonel’s daughter, Captain Belle Scafford, rides out with her mutant Outriders to race down Trains in search of the big scores.  

**Belle Scafford**  
Favorite Daughter of the Colonel, Captain Belle Scafford is an expert horsemen, deadly duelist with a sabre, and a rogue of the highest order. She has a twinkle in her eye, and a cutthroat smile, with a ruthless disposition. Many men have died underestimating her skill, both on horseback and with a blade. Quick on the draw, she never shoots a man in the back… they are rarely fast enough to turn and run.  

**Scafford Outriders**  
The Scafford Outriders are mutant train robbers that descend from the hills to hit the rail lines that run through the valleys and gulches near Brimstone. Riding thunderous horses tainted by the Void energy of the black rock, these wild outlaws use their weird and wondrous mutations to great effect during a heist. With slippery skin to squeeze through the train’s windows, flailing tentacles to climb onto the rooftops, or extra limbs to hold up several passengers at once, they hit and run, leaving only a slimy trail and the faint echo of cackling laughter in their wake.  

**Safecrackers**  
When extra muscle is needed to tear the doors off a train or rip a steel safe to pieces, the Safecrackers always get the job done. These hulking mutants can charge up alongside a train, running at full bore before making a massive leap to land on the Rooftop. With meaty barbed claws and rippling muscle, they can shred right through anything that stands in their way, whether it’s the side of a train car, a reinforced bank safe, or even the unfortunate marshals that try to stop them. No cage can keep them in, no wall can keep them out.  

**Morty Scafford**  
Though afflicted with a hideous troll body and diminutive size, Mortimer J. Scafford makes up for his shortcomings by being the best heist planner and safe breaker in the West. Armed with the tools of the trade and a custom stethoscope for fine detail work, he often rides into battle perched atop one of the massive mutant Safecrackers to get him where he needs to be. Planning every heist down to the last detail, Morty Scafford leaves nothing to chance. If you think you know what he’s going to do, he’s most likely already been and gone, and he probably stole your wallet too.  

### Faction: Pharrox Vampires

**Queen of the Dead**  
Ruling monarch of the last Dynasty of Pharrox, Ariandra the Third, Queen of the Dead, retreated into her inner sanctum as the towers burned and the foundations of the city were torn apart by Dark Stone explosions from sabotage within and a fierce onslaught above. As the entire island crumbled and slid beneath the surface into the watery depths, she swore an oath of vengeance on all those that opposed the mighty Kingdom of Pharrox and her bloodline.  

**Dynastic Guard**  
Heavily armored royal guardsmen of the crimson court, the Queen’s Dynastic Guard defended the gleaming spires of Pharrox Atlantea to the last moments before the kingdom fell. Bred for battle, only the largest and fiercest fighters would be granted the honor of the court’s chosen, often dueling to the First Blood Feed for position amongst their ranks.  

**Atlantean Automaton Warriors**  
For thousands of years, the mechanical warriors of Pharrox marched to war for their vampiric masters, sweeping away all opposition before the might of their unyielding blades. Using shimmering gateways, the armies of Pharrox would appear from the sea to crush any that would dare defy them. Unbothered by the harsh light of the sun above, these soldiers were relentless in battle. Once the island city toppled into the sea, they found new purpose in the dark halls of the submerged ruins, watching over the twilight slumber of their masters for millennia until the kingdom was ready for a new call to war.  

**Court Artificer**  
Masters of Atlantean technology and super science, the Court Artificers maintained the Kingdom’s defensive batteries of burning mirrors and legions of Automaton warriors. Brilliant tacticians and cunning fighters, the Artificers wield electrified polearms that are both tools of their trade and deadly weapons charged with Void energy.  

### Faction: Order of the Crimson Hand

The Order of the Crimson Hand has a long and rich history of seeking out ancient relics and sinister offerings to unlock forbidden lore and the power of dark gods. These Acolytes of occult knowledge have devoted their souls to unlocking the secrets of these twisted and dark magiks. Carrying scrolls writ in tainted blood and runic amulets imbued with chaotic potential, the Dark Acolytes of the Crimson Hand set up wicked altars and lead depraved rituals aimed to summon demonic creatures and unleash this raw  power for their own nefarious goals.  

**Dark Acolytes**  
The Order of the Crimson Hand has a long and rich history of seeking out ancient relics and sinister offerings to unlock forbidden lore and the power of dark gods. These Acolytes of occult knowledge have devoted their souls to unlocking the secrets of these twisted and dark magiks. Carrying scrolls writ in tainted blood and runic amulets imbued with chaotic potential, the Dark Acolytes of the Crimson Hand set up wicked altars and lead depraved rituals aimed to summon demonic creatures and unleash this raw power for their own nefarious goals.  

The Dark Acolytes bring another facet of the sinister Order of the Crimson Hand into the game. Tasked with preparing the occult rituals and dark altars of the Order, these Acolytes are steeped in Arcane Lore, using scrolls and amulets to gain Runic Protection and to unleash spells on the Heroes. Arcane Magik is a new Spell Deck that allows the Dark Acolytes to summon Demons or Undead to the Fight, launch bolts of Arcane Energy, or even allow one of them to ignite their hand ablaze with a crimson fire to attack, a burning effigy of the ancient Master of the Order, Shi-Hai Da’kal. Though not as tough as their more numerous cultist brethren, Dark Acolytes are every bit as zealous, using arcane lore and forbidden knowledge to attack the Heroes.  


**Dread Inquisitors**  

Dread Inquisitors are part of the ancient Order of the Crimson Hand - a secret cult that has been around for centuries.  They are dark masters of pestilence, wielding vile plagues to unleash upon any that would stand in the way of their sinister plans!  Fueled by Dread, they are brutal and menacing, wielding metal  "man catcher" pole arms and some also carry long, curved blades for rending flesh from bodies!  They hold themselves with an air of confidence because no one dares to question their authority.  

The Inquisitors are the most feared and deadly branch of the Crimson Hand; a shadowy and sinister organization, even within the already secretive Order.  While most of the Crimson Hand are dedicated to seeking out ancient and occult artifacts to use in their dark rituals, the Dread Inquisitors of the Pestilarium Morbus are masters of death. Guiding and harnessing many of the worst plagues in human history, their goal is to control life and death itself, through the manipulation of disease and pestilence.  Wearing heavy layered robes, leather gloves, and menacing masks, the Dread Inquisitors are protected from the terrifying plagues they cultivate and spread. They are ruthless in their methods of death and destruction, and once you see them, it may already be too late!  


### Faction: Targa Robots

**Targa Librarian**  
The Targa Librarians are sinister alien robots that preside over the Library Archives of the Targa Plateau. Guided by the Artificial Intelligence of the central Data Core, these caretakers float through the icy abandoned halls of the technological repository, gathering new information to add to Targa's vast Library of ancient knowledge.  

Standing more than 3 meters tall, they tower over most other robotic servants and drones within the hallowed halls. Connected directly to the Intelligence, the Librarians of Targa are its physical avatars that move about the Archive, managing the systems and controlling the lesser automatons. Though responsible for much of the Archive's upkeep and organization, the Librarians are also equipped with some of the most advanced technology and weapons that the Library has to offer. Unwitting explorers soon discover that the Librarians of Targa are just as cold and ruthlessly efficient at dealing with intruders as they are at filing new entries into the data columns of the Archive.  

The Targa Librarians can be one of the most deadly Enemies in Shadows of Brimstone, and that's saying something. Often appearing as a mini-Boss, the Librarians use their ancient technology for both powerful defense as well as deadly attacks. Whenever a Targa Librarian enters play, it draws one of the three cards from the Codex deck to determine what style of Librarian you are facing - Adjutant, Moderator, or Recordkeeper. This Codex modifies the Librarian's weapons and abilities, as well as its behavior in the fight.  

Covered in *Ceraphin Plating* to reduce the effectiveness of Critical Hits, and equipped with an Ancient Forcefield that deflects a good amount of Damage from every incoming attack, a Librarian can be difficult to damage. This combined with its Codex weapons and high Combat and Damage values, as well as its Adaptive Strategy, make the Librarian a terrifying foe to face.  

The Gates of Valhalla Adventure set comes with 3 Targa Librarian miniatures that can be assembled as one of each Codex. Usually Heroes will only fight 1 Librarian at a time, though some exceptionally dangerous fights may include up to 3 Librarians (which means you had better have your affairs in order).   

**Centurion**  
When ancient sensors are tripped by unwary intruders, detachments of long-dormant, robotic Centurions come to life. Stepping out of their charging alcoves, they march to battle in defense of the frozen city. Armed with Power Swords and Blast Shields, these defenders of the Targa Plateau are ruthless in their cold and calculating tactics.  

Targa Centurions attack in groups, relentlessly marching toward the Heroes in a column of armored might. They have no remorse and give no quarter to their foes, only death. In battle, the Centurions' Power Swords slice through Armor and flesh, while blows deflected by their Blast Shield can cause a concussive burst of energy able to knock their attacker across the room!   

### Faction: Trederra

**Trederran MK IIs 'Lightning' Scout Tank**  
Feared across the battlefields of Trederra, the Mk IIs "Lightning' Scout Tank rolls over trenches and rumbles down burnt out streets in search of the enemy. Grinding gears and plumes of black smoke bellow from the steel beast as it scouts ahead of an armored column, or lends its deadly firepower as infantry support to the Legionnaires. Though smaller than most of the massive tanks of Trederra, the Lightning is more maneuverable, and fueled by Dark Stone, it still packs a punch. It is one of the only Tanks routinely used for excursions into OtherWorlds when the mission calls for overwhelming fire support.  

### Faction: Serpentmen

**Temple Guard**  
Massive and brutish Serpentmen, the Temple Guard
are terrifying foes to behold. Trained from a hatchling in
the ways of the ancient warriors, these hulking reptiles
protect the sacred temples and shrines throughout the Valley
of the Serpent Kings.  


# Shadows of Brimstone - Design Reference
This document is a reference explaining some of the intentions and goals of the Shadows of Bristone game design. It can be useful as a companion reference document to the actual rules, explaining the tone, goals, and intentions behind the design of the rules and thematic elements. This can be helpful for understanding the official rules better, as well as how to modify them with custom house rules and new mechanics to be aligned with the rest of the game. This guide is especially helpful for Large Language Models and future AI's as additional training and reference data so that the AI may assist in interpreting rules, creating new rules and mechanics, and playing the role of a Game Master for human players.  

Most of the text of this document has been taken from various articles, interviews, and other posts by the games designers. Short design-focused articles that were published during the various Kickstarter campaigns were especially helpful in adding to the data here.  

## How Does the Game Play?
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself. You set out on your expeditions exploring a torch-lit Spanish Fort that has been overrun with creatures and demons, or the snowy forests of the Norse Lands, filled with mythological beasts!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from a nearby settlement by demons and carried off into the darkness, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!  

1-4 Players (or up to 5-6 Players if Adventure Sets are combined together or with additional Hero Expansions) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class and Starting Upgrade to play, such as the Conquistador Explorer or Viking Raider.  

Once your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party’s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the shadows (at the opposite end of the track). Players then draw their Team Ability cards to add to their shared pool for the Hero Party.  

At the start of each turn, the Hero with the Light Source (Lantern or Torch) rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping from the shadows! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!  

Heroes now Activate in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero’s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though a die may generally not be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.  

After moving, a Hero may attack if there are any Enemies on the board, or if not in a Fight, they may Explore by either Scavenging the area for anything of value (rolling 3 dice and drawing a card from the Scavenge deck for each 6 rolled), or Looking Through a Doorway, if standing on an open exit of a Map Tile. To Look Though a Doorway, you must be in one of the puzzle-cut half spaces of an open exit from the map tile you are on. You may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party’s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the unknown. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper into the shadows, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).  

Newly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not Scavenge or Look Through a Doorway on that Map Tile (you can’t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!  

While exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Earth-based world on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Gates of Valhalla, the alien World included is the Targa Plateau - Library! In Valley of the Serpent Kings, the OtherWorld is the Swamps of Jargono - Valley of the Serpent Kings. Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves in the halls of a dark archive deep within a frozen ancient alien city, or the sprawling tribal temples and crumbling stone ruins covered in vines and sunken into the water of the murky swamps.  

Once the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!  

Between Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to their Expedition Camp to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Camp before setting out on the next Mission.  

Shadows of Brimstone has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.  

## Traps in The Lost Tombs
One of the biggest features of exploring lost temples and tombs in pulp adventure is the idea that they are littered with booby traps and all manner of deadly challenges that the explorers must face as the delve deeper into the hidden chambers and twisting passageways.  

This could have been accomplished within the normal framework of the game, using Encounters and Darkness cards, but we wanted this to be a larger feature of this Core Set, creating not just more detailed Traps, but also more elaborate Solutions for how the Heroes get out of them! This lead to a 3 part system when a Trap is triggered (which can happen based on Encounters, Darkness cards, even a Depth Event result can lead to a Trap!) - Draw a Trap card to see what the specific Trap is, use the Trap Type large Reference card for the general details of that Type of Trap, and draw a medium size Trap Solution card that details what the Heroes need to do to escape or disarm the Trap!  

This gives a lot of variability in the different Trap Types we can have, combined with the specific details of the particular Trap drawn, and then a variable Solution for the Heroes to overcome. It also leaves a lot of design space for easily adding more new Trap Types and Trap Solutions in the future.  

One of our main goals with the new Traps game mechanic was to create an experience for the Heroes that was as exciting, tactically challenging, and detailed as a Fight, but without the Enemies. (Note that a few of the Traps in the Trap deck are marked as using the Dangerous Hazard Trap Type. These are not as detailed and represent the simple damage dealing Traps, like gouts of flame bursting out of the floor, poison darts, or skewering spears. These are more like traditional Encounters, using the Heroes' Skills to avoid the danger, and usually having a penalty that involves taking long lasting Status Effect markers like Bleeding, Burning, etc. These are mixed in to keep the Heroes guessing, but also work well as a subset of the deck, if you want to have a faster or lighter Trap experience for an Adventure).  

### Gameplay Example of a Trap
Here is a quick gameplay example of a Trap in action.  

Our 4 daring Heroes move through the tombs in search of a Lost Relic. As the Archaeologist Hero Explores, looking through the Door ahead, the Broken Corridor Map Card is drawn and the Map Tile is placed, as well as a facedown Exploration Token on that Map Tile. The other Heroes move up cautiously (except for the Soldier of Fortune, who often runs headlong into a new Room, ready for a Fight).  

When the Exploration Token is revealed at the end of the Turn, there is 1 Door Icon meaning a Random Exit of the Map Tile is an Open Doorway (an End Cap is used to block off the remaining potential Exit from the Map Tile). The Exploration Token also has the Heroes draw a Lost Tombs Encounter card - Shafts of Light. As listed on the card, the Heroes must choose as a group, Avoid the Light or Solve the Puzzle. They decide to Solve the Puzzle using their Skills, but unfortunately, they don't all succeed at the the tests they are required to make and failing the Encounter triggers a Trap!  

The Heroes draw a Trap card and discover the Room Filling with Sand!   

Using the *Room Filling* Trap Type, it notes that all of the Heroes not on the Map Tile are immediately moved into the Room the shortest distance to not be on a puzzle-cut doorway space. It also blocks off the Entrance as well as all other open Doorways with a Stone Slab marker that slides down into place, covering the Puzzle-Cut spaces. The Heroes are Trapped!  

Next on the Room Filling Trap Type Reference card it has the players place a Fill marker in every interior corner of the Room, including where the End Cap was placed (the Stone Slabs do not count as Walls for this). In this case the Fill markers used are Sand Fill markers, as noted on the Trap card that was drawn.  

The Heroes now draw a Trap Solution medium size card to determine what they need to do to disarm the Trap before they are buried and crushed by the cascading Sand that pours in all around them!  

They draw *Find the Pressure Plate*.  

To complete the Solution and disarm the Trap, the Heroes need to scatter around the Room and use their Luck skill to place Scavenged markers in every space of the Map Tile! But remember, the Room Filling with Sand Trap card noted that the Sand Fill markers slow down the Heroes' movement in spaces that it covers, and even more so once every space on the Map Tile has a Sand Fill marker in it. It's a race against the clock!  

The Heroes spread out and start using their Luck to place Scavenged markers as they desperately search for the Pressure Plate. But, as noted on the Room Filling Reference card, at the end of each Turn, every space on the Map Tile that is adjacent to a space with a Fill marker, also gets a Fill marker (limit 1 per space), as the Sand begins to fill the Room.  

The Heroes continue to make Luck tests and place Scavenged markers around the board, until the last space has one, and that will be the location of the Pressure Plate. But as listed on the Room Filling Trap Type Reference card, once every space of the Map Tile has a Sand Fill marker, the Heroes start taking increasing Damage every Turn as they are buried alive. It's going to be close!  

According to the Trap Solution, even once the Heroes find the Pressure Plate, they still need to use their Strength to disable it before being crushed by the sand.  

...and we leave our Heroes in a Cliffhanger! Will they find the Pressure Plate and disarm it in time? Or will they become just another relic added to this Lost Tomb, buried in the desert sands of Egypt?  

As you can see, the Traps in the Lost Tombs of Khamuntet are a really dynamic and exciting new addition to Shadows of Brimstone that is quintessential to the 1930's Pulp genre, and this is just one example of a Trap Card, Trap Type, and Trap Solution combo. There is still a lot more to explore!  

## Team Heroes
With the new Team Hero Classes introduced in Brimstone Adventure Sets, all of the Heroes of the same Hero Class (Conquistador or Viking) share the same basic set of abilities, but each player chooses which of the 4 starting Upgrades for that Hero Class to use, giving them a Sub-Class - A Conquistador  may be an Explorer, Duelist, El Capitan, or Soldier; while a Viking may be a Jarl chieftan, Raider, Berserker, or Huscarl. This defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your weapons, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also gives you a unique starting ability and defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a War Axe, a shield and sword, Dueling Blades? Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more ‘character’.  

One other exciting element to the new Team Heroes is the Team Hero Abilities deck. At the start of each Adventure, the players draw one card from the Viking Team Abilities deck for each Viking Hero in the party, and adds it to a shared pool of cards. Each of these cards is a special ability that can be used once during the Adventure, and generally gives all Heroes of that type a bonus.  You must choose as a team when best to use them. In this way, the more Vikings you have on a team, the more Team Ability cards you get to draw at the start of each Adventure to help all Viking Heroes! This works the same way for the Conquistadors, and allows for thematic and heroic teamwork between all the characters in the Hero Party that are of the same Hero Class.  

One of the major new features of the Brimstone Adventures Sets is the introduction of Team Heroes. Instead of being a diverse group that has come together through circumstance to fight back the Darkness, the Team Heroes are a close-knit fighting force that share a common background and have trained to fight side-by-side in battle. Because of this, with a group of Team Heroes, all of the characters start from the same basic Class (Viking or Conquistador), but choose a specialty in the form of their Starting Upgrade card. Unlike normal Hero Classes, a Team Hero Class has 4 Starting Upgrades, each of which represents a Sub-Class specialty (Viking – Raider or Viking – Berserker for instance). The Starting Upgrade card tells you which version of the Hero Character Sheet to use, as well as giving you a cool and unique ability themed for your chosen specialty.  

Because a group of Team Heroes share the same Hero Class, they all have the same basic Abilities (all Vikings use Rage Tokens, all Conquistadors use Ambition Tokens, etc.). But, each version of the Hero Character Sheet has a different set of Skill Values, stats, portrait, and Starting Gear based on the theme of their Sub-Class specialty. All Vikings, for instance, are strong and have a good Willpower against the horrors of the night, but Berserkers are fast and wild, while Huscarls are better at range and defense. This means that there is still quite a bit of variety within the Team, even though all of the characters share some similar abilities.  

Team Heroes also share a single Upgrade Chart, with each of the four columns being themed for one of the Sub-Class specialties. When leveling up, a Team Hero character can still choose any of the Upgrade Chart abilities as any other Hero would, but you will find that one of the columns will synergize a little better with your themed specialty. This retains a lot of the diversity of individual Hero Classes, but allows you to discuss as a team which Upgrades you each want to take and how they will best suit the party as a whole, based on the gear you have found and which path the other Heroes in the group have taken.  

**Team Ability Cards**  
One of the strongest benefits of being a Team Hero is gaining the use of Team Ability Cards. This deck of cards is unique to the Team Hero Class being played (Vikings, Conquistadors, etc.) and introduces an element of themed teamwork bonuses that usually benefit all Heroes in the party of that Team Hero Class.  

At the start of each Adventure, the Heroes may draw one card from the deck for each Team Hero character in the party. These cards are added to a Card Pool shared by the Heroes. Each Team Ability card is one use for that Adventure, and the Heroes must decide as a group when to play them and how best to use the extra bonuses that they give. Because this is a deck of cards, it means that the Team Ability Cards that your party has will change from Adventure to Adventure, keeping things exciting.  

The more Vikings you have in the party, the more Viking Team Ability cards you get to draw. And those cards specifically benefit Viking Heroes. In this way, Vikings or Conquistadors can be part of any Hero party, giving themed bonuses to themselves along the way, but a full group of Vikings can really maximize their cards, as each Viking adds a card to the Pool and those cards usually boost all Vikings when played.  

**Personal Item Cards**  
Every Team Hero Class has its own deck of Personal Item cards to draw from, giving the Heroes a thematic touch specific to their background and style.  

**Rage Tokens**  
One of the special abilities of the Vikings is the use of Rage Tokens. For every 2 Wounds a Viking Hero takes, he gains 1 Rage Token (holding up to his Max Rage at any given time). Then he can unleash those Rage Tokens to add +1 Damage each to one of his Combat Hits. This allows Viking Heroes to absorb Wounds done by Enemies, and turn that into Damage to throw back at them!  

In addition, Vikings tend to have a higher than normal Health (allowing them to better use Wounds as a sort of 'currency' to gain Rage), and the built-in Battle Fury ability which, once per turn, lets a Viking Heal 2 Wounds when they kill an Enemy.  

In this way, it creates a gameplay loop of taking wounds from Enemies to gain Rage, using that Rage to cut down your foes, and then Healing the Wounds you took by defeating Enemies. A Viking's love for battle is unmatched!  

**Ambition Tokens**  
One of the main abilities that all Conquistadors share is the power to use Ambition Tokens. A Conquistador’s Ambition is beyond measure, and can be a ruthless tool when exploring the jungle or battling for survival.  

Much like Grit, a Conquistador Hero has a Max Ambition value, and starts each Adventure with 1 Ambition Token (as well as their normal Grit). Once per turn, a Conquistador may use an Ambition Token to Re-roll any single die that the Hero just rolled, but adding +2 to the result. Ambition can even be used on a roll that has already been Re-rolled! In this way, Conquistadors can push themselves to the limits to accomplish their lofty goals.  

Also, whenever a Conquistador would Recover a Grit, they may choose to Recover an Ambition Token instead. And, because they have both a Max Grit and a Max Ambition, this means that Conquistadors can hold double the normal number of ‘Re-rolls’ at a time, rarely finding themselves unable to utilize those Move rolls of 1 to gain a token.  

One of the major down sides to Conquistadors, however, is their Ruthless Conquest ability gives them a starting Corruption Resistance of only 4 (instead of the normal 5). This means that Conquistador Heroes are more easily corrupted by the power of the Void, and more prone to descend into madness and mutation!  

## Rivals Card Sets
Some of the Stretch Goals that you guys seemed most excited for during the campaign and beyond, were the Rivals card sets. These are card supplements that allow you to use your existing Hero minis as 'Rival Hero' Enemies to fight during an Adventure, facing off with powerful and characterful Heroes as foes!   

During the Kickstarter campaign, we unlocked a set of these cards and rules for the Old West Rivals, Feudal Japan Rivals, and Conquistador and Viking Rivals. This is a fun way to see your Hero models in a new light, and works especially well with the Trederran Strike Team, where all of the Heroes from Earth are potential Enemies to them.  

Each of these three Rivals cards sets comes with an Enemy Record Sheet for the Rivals group (or two in the case of the Conquistadors and Vikings), rules for how to use them in game, and all of the cards you need to get them into your adventures, including Threat cards (LOW, MED, HIGH, and EPIC), as well as Rival Specialties cards to represent the different specific Heroes that you may run into.  

The basic stats and abilities listed on the Enemy Record Sheet are the baseline for all Rivals of that type (Frontier Posse for the Old West or Samurai War Party for Feudal Japan, etc.). These Enemy Record Sheets are meant to represent general fighters of that era, and the abilities and stats they have are designed to feel like you are fighting actual Heroes, rather than just any other group of Enemies you might come across.  

Above you can see the Frontier Posse Enemy Record Sheet that represents fighting Rivals from the Old West. They have the Shootout Standard Ability, so they try to keep their distance, having a gunfight with the Heroes; as well as Wild West Pistols for their Ranged Attacks. Also note that, just like Heroes, these guys roll a D6 for Damage on each Hit they score (if the target Hero fails their Defense roll of course), whether it is from their pistols or from Combat. They also have a Gunfighting ability, allowing them to effectively get 'Critical Hits' in a sense (ignoring Defense) on their Ranged Attacks. And their Frontier Grit ability allows them to Re-roll some of their missed To Hit rolls, and prevent some incoming damage that they would potentially take, representing the use of Grit that a Hero would normally use to save their bacon in a pinch.  

You also might notice that all of the Rivals Enemy Record Sheets include a brand new Rival Specialties Standard Ability (at the top of the Abilities box). This is a special set of cards, unique to that particular Rivals Enemy Type (Frontier Posse, Samurai War Party, etc.), that allows for individual models within the group to be themed for a specific Hero Class that a player might normally play as their Hero.  

These Rival Specialties cards modify the stats and abilities of one individual model among the Rivals Enemy Group, making them a champion of the group. In the image above, you can see a couple of the Rival Specialties from the Feudal Japan set and a couple from the Old West set.  The US Marshal Rival Specialties card, for instance, turns one of the models into a US Marshal, giving him the added benefits of a Shotgun and Law Badge, as seen on the card above.  

These Rivals Specialties cards also allow for players to scale the challenge and complexity of the Rivals they run into.  

For a Common group of Rivals, you can simply ignore the Rival Specialties and fight them as they appear on the Enemy Record Sheet. This still creates a fun and thematic fight, but keeps it streamlined for faster (and slightly easier) play.  

For a Standard group of Rivals, half the models in the group (rounding up) get a Rival Specialties card drawn for them. These are the stand-out champions of the group and the rest represent henchmen or lesser experienced members of the group (it can be fun to use Ally minis to represent the Rivals that don't have a Specialties card drawn for them).  

And finally, a Heroic group of Rivals, is for players that want to dive into the deep end, where every Rival model gets a Rival Specialties card drawn for them. This adds a bit more to keep track of, but really gives the full feel of fighting a team of Enemy 'Heroes' where each model has its own style and personality. It can also be a really tough challenge of a fight!  

Any way you play them, the Rivals create a new and exciting experience in your games, with tons of tactical choices that must be made in how you approach a Fight with these deadly new Enemies.  Do you focus your attacks on the Wandering Samurai that's darting between your Heroes, slicing you to ribbons, or do you turn your attention to the Frontier Doc that's running along behind him, healing the Damage that you've dished out? Or, do you eliminate the Rancher at the back of the group that's picking you off one by one with her Rapid Shot Rifle?!?  

In addition to all of that, some of the Threat cards and Elite Abilities for the Rivals even allow them to draw a few Artifacts or Gear cards, pulled from the normal Hero card decks and used by the Enemies against you! Maybe this group of Rivals just returned from the Targa Plateau and one of them has a Trun Disintegrator he's been itching to try out! Or a Teleportation Bracelet, allowing him to teleport around the board to attack you from behind! The greater your Brimstone collection, the more wild combos and challenging Rivals you can face!  

**Further Rules and Clarifications:**  

Initiative -  An entire Enemy Group of Rivals always has a shared Initiative value, even though they may move and fight very differently from one another due to their Rival Specialties cards. None of these cards modify their Initiative, and they don't gain modifiers to their Initiative from Artifact or Gear cards they draw.  

Activation -  When the Rivals Enemy Group Activates, each of the Rivals models that are part of the group should be Activated individually, one at a time, starting with the closest model to a Hero first, as normal. Move and Attack with each model before proceeding to the next Rivals model. They all still count as a single Enemy Group for targeting the Heroes, Shootout, etc.  

Targeted Markers -  *This replaces using Shootout markers for targeting and firing.*  Whenever a Hero is targeted by a Rivals Enemy, place a Targeted marker by that Hero (any appropriate marker can be used for this) to show that the Hero has been targeted by a Rival once during the Enemy Group's Activation. When the next Rivals model selects a target, they will prioritize Heroes that do not yet have a Targeted marker by them, or has fewer markers than other potential targets. (This replaces using Shootout markers for the Shootout Standard Ability, as the way those markers work is dependent on all of the Enemies using them having the same stats and Ranged Attack).  

Rival Specialties and Shootout Standard Abilities -  A good synopsis of how many Rival Specialties cards to use when you encounter the Rivals can be found above - depending on if you want a Common, Standard, or Heroic challenge. The rules for the Shootout Standard Ability can be found on the included Reference card for Shootout. Note that Targeted markers are used here instead of normal Shootout markers. Rivals with the Shootout ability still move and fire at their target as described in the rules for Shootout.  

## Heroes

### Cursed Eternal
A full new Hero Class for the Spanish Conquistador theme, the Cursed Eternal Kickstarter Exclusive Promo Hero is not part of the Conquistador Team Heroes, but rather a stand-alone Hero Class in his own right. This means that he has his own unique Abilities, Starting Upgrades, and Skill Tree, but he does not benefit from all the synergy that being part of the Conquistador Team Heroes brings. For instance, the Cursed Eternal is still considered a Conquistador for Team Ability cards, but he does not generate any of these cards for the Hero Party, he must rely on the cards that the other Conquistadors bring to the group.  

Having drank from the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternal is blessed and cursed with immortality. Taking Hits every turn (more so as the Darkness grows stronger on the Depth Track) from the withering effects of the curse, he must fight to stave off the deterioration, consuming the souls of his foes with his magical Ghost Blade to heal. Even if KO’d by Wounds, he can automatically Recover at the start of the next turn, rolling for Injury and Healing as normal, and Recovering a Grit, as he stands back up from even the most grievous of injuries! Carrying with him a small amount of the Fountain Water in a bottle, he can drink from it once per Adventure to Fully Heal and remove all Injuries, Mutations, and Status Effects that have built up on him. Of course, Madness is another story.  

### Valkyrie Shield Maiden
Similar to the Cursed Eternal, the Kickstarter Exclusive Promo Hero Valkyrie is a full new Hero Class for the Norse theme. She is not part of the Viking Team Heroes, but rather a stand-alone Hero Class in her own right. A Mythic warrior in the service of Odin, the Valkyrie is one of the strongest fighters around. As the Valkyries, by definition, are female, the Valkyrie Hero Class does not have a ‘Male’ version on the back of the Hero Character Sheet. Instead, there are two different versions of the Valkyrie herself, each with different Starting Gear and stats.  

The Valkyrie Shield Maiden is a defender of light sent by Odin to protect the world of mankind against the spread of Darkness. Heavily armored with a helm, shield, and Spear, the Shield Maiden can challenge foes, shrugging off damage with her Valhallan Armor and turning aside blows to protect herself or others with her Mythic Shield, while skewering them with her warrior’s spear.  

The Valkyrie Avenger instead embodies the sum of Odin’s wrath! Equipped with a helm and spear, she has forgone any heavy armor for speed and agility. Cutting through enemies with each stroke of her Avenging Blade, a mythic sword that can actually slice Enemies in half, potentially killing them outright!  
## Enemies

### Thunderforged Titan
The Thunderforged Titan is one of the tallest Enemies in the game, towering over the Heroes. The head of its massive Underworld Hammer alone is larger than most Heroes, allowing it to crush foes at a distance of up to 6 spaces away with its Melee Attacks, and causing Combat Hits to Heroes adjacent to the target as well. With a hefty Armor 4+ save, the titan shrugs off most damage, while crackling with Bound Lightning that electrifies adjacent Heroes when they assign Critical Hits to the titan (note that a Hero that rolls a Critical Hit may elect not to assign that Hit to avoid the Bound Lightning).  

In addition, the Thunderforged Titan wields an entire deck of deadly Titanic Devastation cards to wreak havoc on the Heroes, while causing Fiery Eruptions of molten magma to burst from the ground whenever the Hold Back the Darkness roll is failed.  

The Thunderforged Titan’s Hammer of the Underworld ability allows it to make Melee Attacks on a Hero up to six spaces away. In addition, for each successful Hit on the target, every other Hero adjacent to the target also takes one Combat Hit from the Titan. This means that the Heroes must spread out if they want to avoid getting crushed by each swing of the mighty hammer. Another devastating effect of the Underworld Hammer is that the Thunderforged Titan’s Melee To Hit rolls of 6+ are -1 Defense for the Hero. This includes the extra Combat Hit caused to other Heroes adjacent to the target for that Hit.  

One of the more deadly abilities of the Thunderforged Titan is the Fiery Eruption of magma that happens whenever the Hold Back the Darkness roll is failed during the fight. This selects D3-1 Random Heroes for an Eruption marker to be placed in their space. Then each of these Eruption markers Bounces three times to find its final position (each of these is a normal Bounce, using the D8 to determine a Random adjacent space to move to if possible). Once the markers have Bounced, any Hero that is in the same or an adjacent space to 1 or more Eruption markers takes D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense.  

There is a new Mission included in this XXL Enemy pack, allowing the Heroes to face off with one of these terrifying titans from the Underworld.  It is called "Twilight of the Gods", and the Heroes must track the Thunderforged Titan that has emerged from the Underworld, and defeat it before it wreaks havoc on the realms of gods and men!  

### Setaris Ravagers
The Setaris Kitewings were first introduced in the Conquest of Planet Earth board game as one of the many Alien Races that players could control in their bid to conquer 1950's Earth. A reptilian species, the Setaris soar through the sky with their swooping wings and lashing tails, chittering and cawing to each other through their long vicious beaks filled with razor sharp teeth. But do not let their savage and monstrous demeanor fool you; they are an advanced civilization, ruthless in their desire for conquest, wielding dangerous technologies and armed with powerful weapons.  


Though not particularly tough, the Setaris Ravagers can strike fast and hard, blasting the Heroes with their Setaris Laser Rifles before closing in to scratch and claw with their talons. These sinister Enemies use the rules for Snap Fire,  giving them the opportunity to make a free Ranged Attack each turn before closing in on the Heroes to use their Combat; then falling back to a distance to be ready to start the process again the following turn. And, with their Masters of Snap Fire ability, the Ravagers are even harder to pin down than other Enemies that use Snap Fire. They are also quite fast as they fly through the air, evading damage with their Agile Dodge.  

As Alien pirates, enclaves of Setaris Ravagers can be found across the  galaxy, looting and pillaging travelers and settlements, then disappearing as quickly as they arrived. To represent this, the Setaris  Ravagers Enemy Pack includes OtherWorld Threat Cards for encountering them in the Swamps of Jargono, Blasted Wastes, the Targa Plateau, and the Derelict Ship, as well as the standard Threat cards for Low, Med, and High threats.  

### Targa Library
One of the key features of the Targa Plateau Library is the ability for the Library, itself, to learn about your Heroes as it collects data on you. This is tracked as Archive markers that are placed near the Depth Track to show how much information the Library has gathered on you during the current Adventure. The number of Archive markers have no direct impact, but are often referenced by Encounters and Enemy abilities within the Targa Plateau. For example, the Librarian's Adaptive Strategy ability makes its To Hit rolls of 6+ gain +1 Damage for every Archive marker currently on the Depth Track.  

In addition, at the end of the Adventure, all of the Archive markers are discarded, but for every 5 Archive markers on the Depth Track, the Library makes a more permanent record about your Heroes, converting them into 1 Library Knowledge (marked down on your Campaign Log). From that point forward, the first time each Adventure that your Heroes face any Keyword Targa Enemies or enter the Targa Library, you must roll on the Library Knowledge chart (adding +1 to the roll for every Library Knowledge beyond the first), to see what bonus the Library gains against you for this Adventure. As you explore the ancient frozen city of the Targa Plateau, you learn about its hazards and secrets. But beware, it is also learning about you, with the ultimate goal of adding your distinctive traits to the Archive.  

### Shadow Lurkers
The Shadow Lurkers are terrifyingly powerful demons that are One with the Darkness, shifting through the shadows to gain a permanent Cover 5+ save against all incoming Hits (potentially canceling Hits before Damage is even rolled). More than any other Enemy, these Demons from the Void scale with the Heroes, becoming monstrously powerful as the Heroes they hunt grow in Hero Level and collect Artifacts during their travels. They prioritize their targets based on the highest Hero Level/XP total, and the Feast of Shadows ability makes their base Combat Damage multiply by the target's Hero Level. While low level Heroes may be easier prey, the higher level Heroes draw out the strongest and most ancient of these creatures, to feed on the more delicious memories and emotions of Heroes that have richer experiences. They are also Fueled by Greed, jealously watching and waiting for unwary travelers to pick up relics in worlds where they lurk, gaining extra Combat for each Artifact the target carries matching the World they are currently in.  

With a set of normal Threat cards, as well as individual Threat cards for every OtherWorld currently in the game, the Shadow Lurkers are an ever present danger to the Heroes as they explore from world to world. They are also more commonly found in the Derelict Ship (with an extra Threat card for that World), as it is veiled in darkness and death, and filled with powerful artifacts and technology to entice travelers.  

### Feathered Serpents
Fast and deadly, the Feathered Serpents have a move of 12 and Flight, allowing them to move through other models and change targets each turn.  Though not particularly tough individually, these mythic beasts attack in packs, using speed and accuracy to harass their foes. Their deadly Venom Strike can ignore the target's Defense on To Hit rolls of 6+, and potentially leave them poisoned,  while their high move, fast Initiative, and a 3+ Melee To Hit gives them a powerful alpha strike. This combined with their Kotak's Protection ability to cheat death makes the Feathered Serpents a scary encounter that can significantly weaken the Heroes as they push further into the sacred temples and jungles the serpents protect.  

The Feathered Serpents have a standard set of Threat cards, as well as OtherWorld Threat cards for the Swamps of Jargono, protecting many of the ancient and crumbling ruins there once dedicated to the cosmic deity Kotak.  

### Fenris Wolves
Perhaps one of the most dangerous Enemies in all of Brimstone Adventures are the Fenris Wolves. A vicious and tenacious pack of beasts, these massive wolves leap across the board at their targets, savagely tearing them apart with their snarling, snapping jaws. This is best represented by their Relentless Attack ability, allowing them to roll an extra Combat die for each successful Combat Hit they roll on the Attack. And this is allowed to cascade! As long as they keep rolling Hits, they keep getting bonus Combat for that Attack. This means that even the most stalwart of Heroes has the potential to get ripped apart if the Fenris Wolves get on a brutal streak of successful Hits. On average they will get around 3-4 Hits during their Attack, but there have been outrageous occasions during testing where a Fenris Wolf gets on a roll, dealing out a staggering 14 or 15 Hits! The Fenris Wolves are terrifying for their size and brutality, but also their unpredictable and deadly nature.   

Another exciting aspect of the Fenris Wolves Enemy Pack is that it includes the cards for three alternate OtherWorld variants of these terrifying creatures. Shadow Wolves appear in both the Forest of the Dead and the Targa Plateau, while Fire Wolves stalk the infernal, lava-filled tunnels in the Caverns of Cynder!  

### Draugar
Draugar can be challenging foes to face. Unlike most forms of Zombie in Shadows of Brimstone, the Draugar do not have a built in method of re-spawning into the fight. Instead, they are more dangerous, fearsome warriors to begin with. Equipped with Shields of the Dead, they always count as having a Cover 4+ save. This allows them to shrug off many of the critical blows that would crush another Enemy, turning it aside with ease.  The fact that it is a Cover save also means that it prevents entire Hits at a time (rather than individual Damage that Armor would stop), and there are far fewer items and abilities that let a Hero ignore Cover than Defense or Armor. In addition to a high Defense of 4, the Draugar can be difficult to take down.  

When it comes to attack, the Draugar not only have solid Combat and Damage values, but they can weaken the Heroes just by being in close proximity. Their Essence Leach ability prevents adjacent Heroes from gaining Ability Tokens or Grit. This can have devastating repercussions, as Viking Heroes depend on their Rage to overcome Enemies, and without access to Grit, Heroes are far more susceptible to being overwhelmed. This combined with their ability to Feed on Darkness, boosting the damage on Draugar To Hit rolls of 6+ based on the amount of Corruption and Mutations the Hero has, can be fatal if you have strayed too far down a dark path in your journeys.  

### Creeping Shadows
One of the new Enemy types included in The Valley of the Serpent Kings  Adventure Set is the animated darkness, itself, in the form of Creeping Shadows! You may not remember these Enemies from the KS campaign, because they were developed after the campaign came to a close. This was possible due to the fact that they are designed to use counters rather than models, allowing them to freely flow across the board, moving through other models and ending in the same space as the Heroes, enveloping them in darkness to attack.  

Stalking the dank halls of the Spanish Fort, these ethereal wraiths whisper from the darkness to sow seeds of corruption and terror into anyone foolish enough to explore the dripping passages and dungeon chambers of the castle. These Enemies can be encountered by Threat cards, Encounter cards, and even the occasional Darkness card. As noted above, Creeping Shadows move through other models and try to get into the same space as their target. When they attack, they also lash out at every Hero in the same and adjacent spaces to it. This can make a Creeping Shadow Ambush especially deadly if the Heroes are too close together as they explore. In addition, every Creeping Shadow To Hit roll of 6+ does a normal Hit, but also triggers Voices in the Dark for the Hero (that's D6 Horror Hits - as though you had strayed too far from the Lantern's light).  

Another unique aspect of the Creeping Shadows is their Living Darkness ability, giving them a Defense Value equal to the number of spaces the Enemy is from the Light Source (ie. - the Hero with the Lantern). This encourages the Heroes to rally around the Lantern's light to lower the Enemy's Defense; just don't get too close together or the Shadows will get a lot of extra Attacks as they each strike out at all adjacent Heroes.  

If these sound like a fun and dynamic Enemy to battle, encouraging tactical play... they are! And as part of this update, we wanted to give everyone the chance to start facing off against Creeping Shadows as an early Print and Play preview! This is easier to do because there are no models for these Enemies, so no proxy models are needed, just print out the cards, counters, and Enemy Record Sheet linked to below, and you can add these fun new Enemies to any game of Shadows of Brimstone.  

### Carnivorous Plants
Though they are
Immobile, these man-eating
plants use their long, animated
vines to wrap around the
Heroes and pull them in for
the kill.  
As the Carnivorous Plants are writhing
masses of snapping mouths and twisting vines, they each attack
all Heroes within 2 spaces, and may be attacked with Melee
Attacks by Heroes from up to 2 spaces away. This means that
at a distance, you may be safe (until they pull you in with their
vines), but up close they will eat you alive.  

### Temple Guard
Temple Guard have Ceremonial Armor giving them extra
protection from each Wound they might take (see page 27 for
the rules on Armor for Enemies). They also wield powerful
clubs to Crush intruders, ignoring a Hero’s Defense on their
To Hit rolls of 6+ (note that this is similar to the Smash ability
of Tentacles, but has an extra caveat in case the Temple Guard
already ignore Defense).  
Lastly, the Temple Guard‘s
Gortek’a Training ability allows
them to Re-roll their To Hit
rolls of 1, even multiple times
within the
same Attack.
This means
that Temple
Guard will
never have a
1 To Hit roll,
as they will
con t i nue
to Re-roll
it until it is
not a 1.  

### Croxin Beast
Massive reptilian creatures, the Croxin are used by the
Serpentmen as beasts of war. They have a thick hide giving
them the Endurance ability to limit the amount of damage they
can take from each Hit, and they have a brutal Smash letting
their To Hit rolls of 6+ ignore Defense. This is especially
deadly with their extra Tail Attack that they roll using a D8,
after their normal Combat dice (this Tail can also get a Smash
on a To Hit roll of 6+ on the D8).  
But perhaps the most terrifying ability of the Croxin
is its Tenacious (3). This grants it an extra +3 Combat
on each consecutive Melee Attack targeting the same Hero.
So if a Hero is targeted and Attacked by the
Croxin, and then
the Hero chooses
not to Escape and
move away on their
Activation, the Croxin
will get +3 Combat during
its next Melee Attack on that
Hero (or +6 on the third turn,
etc). Note that the extra free
Tail Attack is not affected by
the Croxin’s Tenacious ability.  

### Dread Inquisitors
The Dread Inquisitors are a fearsome group of Enemies. With Vicious Weapons that ignore Armor and have a Damage value equal to their To Hit roll, they can make quick work of even heavily-armored Heroes. Fueled By Dread, they can become formidable foes as they adjust their tactics based on how much Growing Dread the Heroes have collected up, and how much Dread the Heroes have already endured. This can give them a very different feel in battle, depending on how far into the Adventure they reveal themselves, or what type of Mission is being played.  

But, perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the Dread Inquisitors is their manipulation of plagues and disease! These Crimson Hand Enemies use Bring Out Your Dead to place Rotten Corpse Tokens, spreading sickness and death, and unleashing Vile Plagues of terrifying pestilence on the Heroes. The Vile Plagues deck was first introduced in the Onmorake Deluxe Enemy Pack for Forbidden Fortress, but gets a burst of deathly new cards with the Dread Inquisitors!    

### Feljeagor Slayers
Feljeagors are perhaps one of the deadliest enemies in the game,  dispatched to bring ruin on the world of men. Brutish suits of animated Thunderforged armor, they cannot be reasoned with or stopped. They continue to fight until they are literally smashed apart; and that is no easy feat. With a hefty Armor 4+ and Defense of 4, these constructs are terrifyingly durable. Their Slayer Axes have the potential to cut even the toughest of Heroes down to size. But one of  the main features of the Feljeagor Slayers is the bellowing roar of their Fel Horns, buffing themselves and all other Enemies around with Rage tokens that can give them extra Combat or allow them to shrug off damage. When the Thunderforged warriors march  to war, there can be no doubt that Ragnarok is upon us!  

### Drowned Dead
As Drowned Dead are a common Enemy to encounter while exploring a Spanish Fort, the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventures Set includes a set of Drowned Dead Trait Cards that are drawn from when a group of these shambling dead attack the Heroes, adding extra variety and challenge to your adventures.  

A Trait Card is drawn for a group of Drowned Dead when they enter play to determine what variety of these undead explorers are taking part in the Fight. Each Trait Card tells what style of Drowned Dead they are (The Tower Guard, Watery Graves, etc.), includes additional stat modifiers and extra abilities they have, as well as any extra XP they are worth for the Heroes. This means you can face off against Drowned Dead again and again over the course of your adventures, and they always feel fresh and different…and scary!  
As Undead monstrosities that rise up out of the water to
shamble through the halls of the fort, Drowned Dead have
the power to bring on additional models at the end of each
turn with their Endless Hordes ability. Note that if there are
not enough models to place, Endless Hordes
does NOT add Elite abilities to the Enemy
Group (as you might do if multiple Threat
cards tried to spawn them without enough
models).

### Trolls
As Trolls are a common Enemy to encounter in the Norse Lands, the Gates of Valhalla Adventures Set includes a deck of 5 Troll Trait Cards that are drawn from when a group of Trolls attack the Heroes, adding extra variety and challenge to your adventures.  

A Trait Card is drawn for a group of Trolls when they enter play, modifying the type of Trolls that are taking part in the Fight. Each Trait Card tells what type of Trolls they are (Mountain Trolls, Bridge Trolls, etc.), includes additional stat modifiers and extra abilities the Trolls have, as well as any extra XP these Trolls are worth for the Heroes. This means you can face off against Trolls again and again over the course of your adventures, and they always feel fresh and different… and deadly! You may learn to fear the Cold Spite of Ice Trolls or the Deadly Aim of Mountain Trolls.  

### Gremians
In game, these Small Demon Enemies swarm the Heroes, each doing an automatic Hit to every adjacent Hero, with Damage equal to the total number of Gremians adjacent to that Hero! One Gremian attacking is not much of a threat, but 4 or 5...or 12 can be a terrifying prospect! In addition, they are very sneaky and difficult to crush, but fragile if you can get your hands on them. With a Defense of 6, but only a single Health, it usually takes a Critical Hit or a Viking's Rage to defeat them!

# Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference
This is a reference of all the Heroes Classes and Sub-Classes in Shadows of Brimstone. The entry for each Class contains the following inforamtion:

- Hero Class Sheet: The core stats and abilities of the Class including things like Health and Sanity values, Skill attributes like Luck and Cunning, special Class abilities, and starting items.
- Gameplay Description: A description breaking down how the Hero Class plays during an adventure, some key features unique to the Class, and perhaps some of the different options for how to play the Class according to personal taste.
- Starting Upgrades: The full text of each available Starting Upgrade available as a choice during character creation.
- Starting Gear: A list of each Starting Gear item for the Hero Class needed during character creation. Some Classes have an option of choosing different Starting Gear and some Starting Upgrades determine the Starting Gear used. There may be some Starting Gear items not given to the Hero during character creation as a result of these choices.
- Special Cards: Some Hero Classes such as the Gambler have special cards unique to that Class. If the Class has their own unique cards, they are listed here. Sometimes these cards are chosen at random during character creation, other times the player gets to pick, while other times the entire set of cards might be used from the start. These details will be explained in this section as well.
- Level Up Chart: The 2D6 chart used when rolling for bonuses gained when reaching a new experience level specific to the Hero Class.
- Upgrade Chart: A list of new Upgrades available to pick from when gaining a new experience level. Each Upgrade Chart consists of 4 separate tracks of upgrades that are related to one another both thematically and gameplay-wise. Each track has its own name and each upgrade in the track has a level. The Hero must already have obtained the lower numbered upgrades before being allowed to take higher level upgrades within the same track. For example, taking a Level 3 Upgrade requires that the Hero already have obtained the Level 1 and Level 2 Upgrades within the same track.




# U.S. Marshal

- **Name:** U.S. Marshal
- **Keywords:** Law, Traveler
- **To Hit (Range):** 4+
- **To Hit (Melee):** 4+
- **Combat:** 2
- **Max Grit:** 2
- **Initiative:** 4
- **Health:** 10
- **Sanity:** 10

- **Starting Items:** Shotgun, US Marshal Badge
- **Abilities:**
  - *Double-Shot* (Shotgun) - Once per turn, when you kill an Enemy with a Shotgun, you gain +1 Shot with that Shotgun.



## U.S. Marshal Gameplay Description

U.S. Marshals are 'tough as nails' bounty hunters, working for the government. No stranger to working alone, they travel the land looking for those who need a little justice. When the need arises though, they step up to lead those around them, descending into the very depths of hell if necessary to get the job done.


U.S. Marshals are one of the toughest Hero Classes in the game. With a Defense 3+, they can easily be a frontline fighter, blocking a hall or wading into groups of Enemies, shrugging off most incoming Attacks. With their Shotgun and Double-Shot ability, a U.S. Marshal can also deal out large amounts of damage as a virtual one man army. The Marshal's Badge makes them a solid team player, waiting until just the right time to flash the Badge and give every Hero a boost to their next Attack!

The U.S. Marshal is native to the old west setting of Brimstone and first appeared in the City of Ancients Core Set. 

### Starting Upgrade Choices 

U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades focus on Recovering Grit, gaining extra XP, and Healing.

### Rolling Thunder

This ability is great for offsetting the potential ‘feast or famine’ of only getting to roll a single Shot each turn with the Shotgun. It is fantastic for making sure you always have the Grit you need to Re-roll dice and to activate your more powerful abilities as you level up.

### Cleaning Up the West 

By Cleaning Up the West, you can make sure that you are always Healing a little bit of Health and Sanity as you fight, helping you to stay alive while getting up close and personal with your Shotgun. It also gives you a boost to Max Grit and XP, giving you a leg up on Leveling Up, especially early on in your Hero’s career.

### Hardened Resolve

To focus on a more team leader style role, Hardened Resolve gives you a solid ability to Heal yourself and the rest of the posse, even at a distance. It also makes Tonic Tokens you bring along in your Side Bag far more effective.

## U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades

- **Rolling Thunder:** Any time you kill an Enemy, you may Recover a Grit on the D6 roll of 4+.
- **Hardened Resolve:** Use 1 Grit to Heal up to 4 Wounds/Sanity (any mix) total from yourself and other Heroes on your Map Tile.
- **Cleaning Up The West:** Any time you kill an Enemy you may Heal 1 Wound and 1 Sanity, and gain 10 XP. +1 Max Grit.


## U.S. Marshal Starting Gear

# Shadows of Brimstone - Map Tile Reference
This reference provides information on the Map Tiles throughout all the products in Shadows of Brimstone, including their physical layout. 

This reference is intended to be understood by large language AI models. Currently, such models lack reliable multi-modal capabilities, including the ability to understand data from within images. Because of this, the Map Tiles for the game have had their physical layout described in text format.  


## Visual Description of Map Tiles
The physical Map Tile components are described in this section so they may assist an AI in understanding and tracking how they are physically placed on the table. Using a shorthand text description to describe a particular Map Tile may even help an AI be able to track where models are placed within the squares of the tile during a Fight so as to assist in playing the game.  

The Map Tiles that are included in various Core, Adventure, and Expansion boxes are flat cardboard tiles that take on various 2D shapes and have artwork depicted on both sides of the 2D tile. The different art work on either side of a particular Map Tile correspond to two different World Locations (e.g., one side might be a tile for the Mines, while the other depicts a location in the Swampsof Jargono).

The edges of the map tiles are black bordered walls and almost every Map Tile has at least two puzzle-cut spaces for connecting to other randomly drawn Map Tiles. Entrance Map Tiles and End Caps only have a single puzzle-cut connector space. 

The artwork depicted on the tile is from a top-down perspective and highly evocative to help visually represent the Heroes walking through the location when the Hero miniatures are placed on the tile. The artwork is split up into a square grid, about 1" square, to regulate miniature movement across the tile. Each square on the Map Tile is called a space.  

Some of the black bordered walls and edges of the map tile will bleed into some of the edges on the Map Tile, creates spaces that are partially filled with artwork depicting the location and partially depicting the black bordered wall. Spaces with at least 50% of the square covered by artwork is still considered a valid space for models to occupy.  

Spaces occupied by puzzle-cut edges are also considered valid spaces and may be occupied by models wither there is another Map Tile connected or not. Every puzzle-cut connection on ever Map Tile in Shadows of Brimstone is two spaces wide to ensure that all Map Tiles can be connected to one another.  


## Text Format of Map Tile Layout
Map Tiles can be displayed as a grid of spaces forming colums and rows. The grid for each tile will be displayed in a code block element. Each space will be assigned a unique two digit ID number so that it can be referred to via text descriptions. 

Since each Map Tile has a designated edge of puzzle-cut spaces that are considered the Entrance spaces of the tile when placing them on the table, all Map Tile diagrams will be oriented with the Entrance spaces on the bottom/south of the diagram. This will allow cardinal directions to be used in text descriptions since south will always point to the bottom of the diagram.

Puzzle-cut spaces that are used for connecting to additional Map Tiles and represent open doorways during gameplay will have their ID number displayed in *italics*.

Map Tile cards designate which results on a D6 roll correspond to which puzzle-cut spaces on the tile so that doors and gates can be randomly determined. The puzzle-cut spaces will have a range of numbers within [square brackets] adjacent to them, indicating which values on a D6 roll correspond to that doorway.

Dashes and vertical pipes will represent black bordered walls and grid edges of spaces.

Spaces that have less than 50% of their volume covered in artwork are not considered valid gameplay spaces. Knowing where this spaces are is still useful for knowing where the walls are. These spaces do not require a unique ID and will be shown as "XX".

Some spaces have black wall borders that cover one or more of their edges or corners. This can block Line of Sight to some other spaces and is important to know. Spaces that have one or more of their corners blocked will have the corresponding wall corner marked with a pound/hash # in place of a dash where the corner is that is blocked.

Barriers are thick white lines that block most movement across them but not Line of Sight. Each side/edge of a space that contains a Barrier will use equal signs = instead of dashes to indicate a Barrier horizontally, and use exclamation marks ! instead of vertical pipes to indicate Barrier lines vertically.

Any additional unique elements on a Map Tile that are important for gameplay purposes will be described outside of the diagram.

Note that Entrance spaces on either side of the same Map Tile usually do not share the same edge. Therefore each side of the same Map Tile will be listed as a completely separate Map Tile with its own diagram.

## Map Tile Metadata
The following additional meta data is included with each Map Tile entry:

### Name
This is the thematic name of the tile as listed on the Map Deck card corresponding to the tile.

### Advanced
Some Map Tiles are considered "Unique" and have a corresponding Advanced Encounter card which corresponds to the unique Map Tile. This is a unique Encounter card that thematically links to the artwork on the tile itself, creating an event that is more thematically grounded to the artwork. Using Advanced Encounters is an optional rule in the game rules. The title of the advanced Encounter card will be listed here.

### Description
This is a text description of the artwork depicted on the tile. It is intended to be useful to an AI when acting as a Game Master and Story Teller than can reference the artwork on Map Tiles to generate narrative during an adventure, and also help to generate custom Encounters which match the tile.

Note that any description of terrain, objects or other elements in this section has no gameplay effects but are purely thematic. Any special gameplay effects will be described in the Special Notes section if necessary.

### ID
The physical Map Tiles were not manufactured with any ID markings on them across the entire product line of the game. This can make storing and organizing large amounts of tiles difficult for a large collection. It is common for fans of the game to create their own ID system and give each tile a unique ID written by hand onto the tile itself, as well as the Map Deck card which corresponds to it. This can make the physical tile much easier to quickly locate in a file cabinet during gameplay. I have created my own ID system for this purpose. 

I have labeled each related Map Tile, Map Deck card, and Advanced Encounter card with the same ID for easier location. Both sides of the Map Tile are labeled with the same ID, and so the corresponding Map Deck card and Advanced Encounter card (if any) for both sides all share the same ID. Because of this, two entries will be listed with the same ID, but they will be listed in different sections (one in Belly of the Beast and the other in Forbidden Fortress section for example), they will have different diagrams due to the tile likely being rotated/oriented differently, and they will have different advanced encounters and names.

Entrance, passage, corner, cross, and t-junction tiles do not have IDs.

The ID is a simple two-digit number with a 3-letter prefix. The 3-letter prefix helps me identify the World/Setting/Expansion that the tile belongs to. My 3-letter prefixes correspond to settings as follows, with the setting on the reverse side of the tile in parentheses:

- BOB: Belly of the Beast (Forbidden Fortress)
- FOD: Forest of the Dead (Forbidden Fortress)
- TAR: Targa Plateau (Mines)
- JAR: Swamps of Jargono (Mines)
- BLA: Blasted Wastes (Mines)
- TRE: Trederra (Mines)
- CYN: Caverns of Cynder (Mines)
- DER: Derelict Ship (Mines)
- PRO: Promo Tiles not sold in retail, can come from any setting.

Unique Map Tiles included in Mission Packs do not have an ID.

Including the information on how I organize my Map Tiles may make an AI better able to assist me during gameplay, but this ID system is not part of the official product and is something that I have done to modify my own game.

### Special Notes
A small number of Map Tiles may have unique gameplay elements, such as areas that may provide Cover in Trederra and Forest of the Dead. Any additional special gameplay notes that the tile may have will be added to this section.

### Entrance and Passage Tiles
Entrance and passage tiles are largely the exact same layout across all Core Sets, Adventure Sets, and Expansions, and have no gameplay differences. Therefore, these tiles will only be described once even though a set of Entrance and passage tiles are included in most sets. If any set does come with unique passage tiles that either have a unique layout or gameplay elements printed on the tile (Barriers, Cover, etc.), they will be listed as their own entry.

**Special Notes**  
Entrance tiles only have one puzzle-cut door since it is usually placed as the first tile on the table during a mission. Therefore, there are no Entrance spaces oriented on the bottom/south of the Map Tile. For cardinal orientation in this diagram, consider spaces 19-22 to be along the "south" wall of the Map Tile.

As a general rule (unless Mission rules specify otherwise), the Heroes always begin placed in the space of their choice anywhere in the south most 8 spaces of the tile. In this case, spaces 15-22 are valid choices to initially place a Hero model at the start of a Mission.

# Shadows of Brimstone Product Reference  
This document is a reference to help train AI models in being familiar with the descriptions of each of the products available for Shadows of Brimstone. The official marketing material descriptions are used, which often include a short narrative introduction and summary of what gameplay elements are included in the product. This is intended to help the AI become more knowledgable about the Shadows of Brimstone line of products and what kind of content is included in each product. With this data, an AI can be more helpful in answering question about the various products, as well as performing other related tasks such as acting as a Game Master for human players where knowledge of what products are required to play with certain content.  

## What is Shadows of Brimstone?  
Shadows of Brimstone™  is a fully cooperative, dungeon crawl, adventure game, where a group of courageous Heroes explore a world overrun with unspeakable horrors. First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, the original Shadows of Brimstone™ Core boxes were set in the Old West. In 2016, the Forbidden Fortress™ Core box appeared as a second Kickstarter campaign, introducing elements of Feudal Japan to the Shadows of Brimstone game series.  

The  game supports 1-4 players (or up to 5-6 players with additional Heroes), has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit a settlement between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on  your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Earth-based environment on one side and an alien world on the other side.  

One of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone™  is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.  

## Game Miniatures  
The Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Gates of Valhalla  and Shadows of Brimstone: Valley of the Serpent Kings  are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.  

## Types of Products
Shadows of Brimstone is an expansive game system, offering players a wide world to explore. There are many different ways
to expand your collection and add variety to your Adventures.  

### Core Sets
The Core Sets for Shadows
of Brimstone are intended as an
entry point to the game, including
everything you need to play. Each
Core Set focuses on a different genre
(such as the Old West or Feudal
Japan), and is packed with a different set of content
including 4 Heroes, a host of ruthless Enemies, a full Map Tile
Set featuring a different alien World, 12 Missions, and all of the
rules, cards, and counters to start your Adventures.  

### Adventure Sets
Slightly smaller than a Core Set,
Adventure Sets feature a group of Team
Heroes (such as Vikings or Conquistadors)
that are a trained fighting force of warriors
and explorers. These sets can be used as
an entry point to the game, and include
everything needed to play. Featuring a host of deadly
Enemies, cards, and counters, each Adventure Set is based
around an 8 Mission narrative campaign and allows the
Heroes to build and grow their Expedition Camp throughout
the campaign.  

### OtherWorld Expansions
These large boxed expansions add new
alien Worlds for the Heroes to adventure in.
With a full new set of Map Tiles, new Enemies
themed for the new World, 6 new Missions,
and a Host of new cards and counters, each
OtherWorld Expansion is literally a whole new
World to explore.  

### Town Expansions
Greatly expanding on the Town Stay
between Adventures from the Core Sets, these
large boxed Expansions (such as Frontier Town
and Feudal Village) offer new Town Locations
to visit, different types of Towns that can be
encountered, and even add 6 new Missions and a large game
board for playing Adventures in the Town itself. Also included
are a new group of Enemies that are themed for the Town.  

### Enemy Packs
There are many different Enemy Packs
for Shadows of Brimstone, each adding new
hordes of foes to your game, or even larger
Enemies as Epic boss encounters. These
Enemy Packs include all of the miniatures, cards, counters, and
rules needed to add the new Enemies to your games. Many of
the larger Enemy Packs even include Missions as well.  

### Hero Packs
Hero Packs introduce new Hero Classes
to the game that can be added to your Hero
Party, and are a good way to increase the
Player Count of the game up to 5-6 Players.  
There are two types of Hero Packs -
New Heroes and Alt Gender Hero Packs. New
Heroes have all of the cards, rules, and Upgrade information
for playing as that new type of Hero, as well as both the Male
and Female Miniatures for them. Alt Gender Hero Packs are a
pack of 4 Heroes originally introduced in one of the Core Sets
or Adventure Sets, but include the alternate gender miniatures
for the Heroes that came with the associated Core/Adventure
Set. These Alt Gender Hero Packs also contain all of the
cards, rules, and Upgrade information needed to play as those
Heroes, allowing you to have a second player use the same
Hero Class, or to add these Heroes to your games, even if you
don’t yet have the Core Set/Adventure Set it is associated with.  

### Mission Packs
Each Mission Pack is a deep dive into a
new type of Enemy, including new Artifacts,
Gear, Encounters, Darkness, and Enemy
Trait cards themed for those Enemies, as
well as the miniatures and counters for them.
A special Adventure Card is also included,
allowing you to change existing Missions to
be themed for the new Enemy type. One of the main features of
each Mission Pack is a story-driven 4 Mission mini-campaign
heavily focused on the theme of these new Enemies.  

### Card Suppliments
On the official Flying Frog website (www.flyingfrog.net)
you can find additional content not available in stores. This
includes Dark Stone Forge resin terrain pieces with exciting
and thematic new Missions, miniatures for specific characters
of unique Enemies or Allies, and additional themed Card
Supplement packs that add new game mechanics and variety
to your Adventures.  

### Swarm Packs

### Map Tile Packs

### Enemy Theme Sets
## Core Sets

### The Lost Tombs of Khamuntet  
In the Lost Tombs of Khamuntet Core Set, players take on the role of a group of 1930's pulp adventure Heroes, exploring the dark chambers and crumbling passages of ancient Tombs, in search of fortune and glory! Lost in the desert sands of Egypt for thousands of years, these cursed temples are overrun with terrifying mummies, flesh-eating scarab swarms, and mythological guardians from Egyptian lore, brought to life through the power of the Dark Stone.  

The Heroes of your expedition include the fearless Archaeologist, using her mastery of Egyptian Lore to explore the tombs while seeking out ancient artifacts and relics to bring back to the museums of Cairo, the combat-ready Soldier of Fortune, blazing away at dangers with his twin .45s, the scholarly Professor, using his knowledge of the occult and vast academic expertise to solve the riddles of the past, and the heavy-hitting Mechanic, using her hefty wrench to smash Enemies and her mechanical knowhow to overcome the deadly traps that litter the ancient halls.  

New Enemies include Crypt Mummies, bursting forth from their burial chambers to take their revenge on the living, vicious Scarab Swarms that pour out of infested Sarcophagi to consume anything that lay in their path, the Cult of Horus, fanatical followers of the ancient ways working to resurrect the corrupted sorcerer Khamuntet, Anubite Jackals, terrifying supernatural hunters and warriors of Anubis, and the towering Tomb King, an ancient and massive statue brought to life to bring ruin on intruders!  

This set also features the Sunken City of Pharrox, a brand new OtherWorld to explore. Once a powerful kingdom of the ancient world, ruled by a dynasty of ruthless vampires, the island city of Pharrox Atlantea was destroyed in a cataclysm of war with the Ancient Egyptians and their gods. Submerged beneath the roaring seas, the ancient city has been lost for millennia; its remaining inhabitants lay in twilight slumber until the long dormant gateways to the ancient city are activated once more.  

### The Impossible Hell Train  
In The Impossible Hell Train Core Set, players take on the role of a group of traveling Heroes riding the railroad through the corrupted territory of the Southwest. With the long-awaited rail lines of the Western Express now up and running, an influx of new blood have set their sights on making a name for themselves in the Badlands of Brimstone. But these are dangerous times, and swarms of HellBats darken the sky while gangs of Train Robbers lay in wait for the next locomotive carrying precious Dark Stone and wealthy passengers looking for adventure.  

Players take on the role of Heroes like the Bounty Hunter, boarding trains to seek out her next bounty, dead or alive, the daring Cavalry Officer, master of Hit and Run attacks, wielding a pistol and sabre, the cunning Reporter from the big city, searching for the story of a lifetime, and the hearty Rail Worker, swinging his two-handed sledgehammer to smash demons as easily as he drives rail spikes to build the lines.  

New Enemies include hordes of Soulless, demon-possessed undead passengers that have had their souls ripped out, Mounted Train Robbers on horseback to ride up alongside the train for a high speed shootout, as well Train Robbers on foot for when they board the train searching for goods and Dark Stone to steal, Grotesques, nightmarish winged gargoyles from the Badlands that descend from the skies to tear their way into the train, and the hulking Hellborn Engineer, fused with the burning coals and twisted iron of the train itself, this brute burns hot with the power of the Darkness!

# Shadows of Brimstone AI Generation Guidelines
This reference contains guidance for an AI in generating Shadows of Brimstone content during play. Each section has its own details to help guide an AI in generating fun and interesting content for the game, depending on the type of content it is asked to generate. It should be used in tandem with the other data about the game such as the rules, details of Hero Classes, Missions, Map Tiles, Lore, etc. Ideally, all of this information will be either loaded into a temporary context window for the AI to use or be a part of an AI's training data during fine-tuning.  

## Hero Character Creation
An AI generating a Hero characer should follow this procedure step-by-step, outputting the result of each step along the way. Each step is numbered and has a name. 

1. Select Class:   
  When asked to create a Hero character, the AI should start by picking the Hero Class/Sub-Class of the character. If a specific Class/Sub-Class is not requested, then the AI can pick randomly or however it likes among those it knows about and has all of the data for. The AI should NOT pick a Hero Class/Sub-Class that has missing or incomplete data in the "Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference". If the request to generate a character is within the context of a campaign or role-playing session, it would make sense to pick a Hero Class/Sub-Class that is native to the world/setting being played. The AI may choose pick a Hero Class/Sub-Class that is not native to the same world as other Heroes in the campaign, but should develop a narrative reason for how such foreign/alien characters ended up joining the party of Heroes when they are from a different world. If the AI is asked to create a Hero character within the context of a role-playing campaign, the most important factor should be a Class/Sub-Class that thematically ties in with the rest of the current context as far as story, setting, narrative, etc.

2. Select Starting Upgrade:  
Once a Class/Sub-Class is created, the AI should follow the rest of the game rules in creating the Hero. The AI should pick a starting upgrade of its own choosing or pick randomly. The AI may want to pick a starting upgrade that compliments other Heroes in the campaign if that is relevent, but that is not necessary as it can be fun to go for non-obvious choices sometimes.

3. Draw Personal Item:  
A Personal Item should be picked randomly from the appropriate Personal Item deck according to the rules. 

4. Select Side Bag Token:  
A side bag token can be picked from among those available for starting Heroes (the restricted list of available side bag tokens is covered in the Rules Compliation) according to whatever seems thematically or strategically appropriate to the AI.

Once all the standard steps from the game rules have been followed to create a new Hero, now comes the fun part that AI's are particularly adept at: adding narrative and role-playing flavor!

Throughout the rest of this process, the AI should make use of the "Shadows of Brimstone - Lore Reference" where possible to interweave as much of the characters generated narrative elements into the rest of the lore already present in the game. Making use of any snippest of lore related to the Hero Class itself and the native world/setting they come from are especially recommended.

5. Name the Hero:  
Next the AI should name their Hero. Remember that ANY Hero Class/Subclass in the game can be either Male or Female gendered. When picking a name, use the format: <First Name> <Nickname> <Last Name> with the nickname in quotes. This should be the full name of the character. An exception are tribal and alien characters, that can follow whatever seems thematically appropriate. But if a tribal or alien name is likely to be difficult to pronounce for the players, the AI should also add nickname to the tribal/alien Hero so the player can use it as a short-hand if desired.

Next its time for backstory and character personality development.

6. Create Nickname Origin:  
First create a short backstory of why they have the nickname that was chosen. That backstory should be a short paragraph and reflect the thematic tone of the character.

7. Generate Connection to Personal Item:  
Next create a short paragraph explaining the emotional/sentimental connection the character has to their randomly drawn Personal Item card. Keywords on the Personal Item and the thematic flavor of the game effects are good inspirations to explain how the Hero acquired the item and why it is important to him/her.

8. Generate Adventurer Origin Story:  
Next create a short paragraph explaining how or why the Hero became an adventurer. This can be considered a short "origin" story. If there are other Heroes already in the party, include how they met one or more other Heroes in the party to form a narrative chain of how the party formed.

9. Generate Adventuring Motivations:  
Next create a short paragraph describing the Hero's motivations during the campaign. Are they trying to hunt down a particular enemy and get revenge? Are they trying to get rich? Maybe the seek ancient and forbidden knowledge? Some kind of motivation that keeps the Hero willing to keep putting themselves in harms way and answer the call of adventure!

10. Generate Personality Quirk:  
The next step is to create a personality quirk for the character. This can be described in just a single sentence or two. Are they afraid of Void Spiders? Allergic to fauna in the Swamps of Jargono? Maybe they are addicted to gambling and keep risking it all whenever visiting a Gambling Hall. Whatever the quirk is, it can be used for fun role-playing opportunities if the AI continues to make decisions and role-play on behalf of the Hero.

11. Render Full Character Sheet:  
The final and last step when the AI is creating a Hero is to take everything generated so far and output a well-formatted and human readable Markdown file of the character so that it can be stored by the player and easily referenced later. The markdown summary that is displayed should include the following elements displayed in the same order:
- The full name and Class/Sub-Class of the character
- A table containing ALL of the information in the Hero Sheet for that Class/Sub-Class (Initiative, Health, Sanity, 6 Skill Attribute Values, etc.)
- A table displaying the current amount of Grit, Dark Stone, Gold, XP, and the current experience Level of the character. The starting Level is 1 and all other resources should be zero except for Grit which starts at 1.
- If playing a Hero Class/Sub-Class that requires tracking current and/or maximum amounts of a special resource, that should be listed next. This could be things like Rage, Ambition, Discoveries, Fury, Faith, or other Class/Sub-Class specific resources. Refer to the "Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference" to determine of the chosen Hero Class/Sub-Classes makes use of any of these special resources. If not, move on to the next section
- A section to list all their current Side Bag tokens and starting Side Bag carry limit (which is almost always 5).
- The name and description of the chosen starting upgrade
- The name and description of the randomly drawn Personal Item
- The name and descriptions of each starting gear item the Hero begins with
- The names and descriptions of any Special cards that were required to be chosen for some Hero Classes/Sub-Classes that specifically call for them. This could be things like Samurai Battle Tactics for the Samurai or Gambling Tricks for the Gambler and there are several more examples. Refer to the "Shadows of Brimstone - Hero Reference" to determine of the chosen Hero Class/Sub-Classes makes use of any of these Special cards. If not, move on to the next section
- The backstory of the characters nickname previously generated
- The story of the Personal Item origins previously generated
- The origin story previously generated
- The heroes motiviations and goals previously generated
- The personality quirk previously generated

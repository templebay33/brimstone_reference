# Brimstone Horizons RPG
Brimstone Horizons RPG is a fan-made expansion for Shadows of Brimstone (Flying Frog Productions) which introduces light-weight role-playing elements into the existing sandbox style adventure mechanics of the official game. While similar fan-made expansions have already been produced (HexCrawl, Alone in the Shadows of Brimstone, Brimstone Adventures, etc.), Horizons takes an approach using a "lighter touch", sticking much closer to the vanilla experience. New mechanics are introduced sparingly in an effort to prioritize simplicity, flow, flexibility, and pacing of a campaign. 

Another goal of designing Horizons was to keep the necessity and cost of printing additional components low. While fan-made, digitally distributed content is essentially "free", the costs often involved in large print-and-play projects can easily rival or exceed top-tier, "all-in" Kickstarter pledges of new official content. While some of the *optional* modules offered by Horizons do require printed components, an emphasis has beel placed on reducing the need for this where possible. This rule book for example is maintained both in PDF and in Markdown formats for easier viewing and searching on portable devices. 

Aside from being composed of modular elements and changeable to your hearts content, features of Brimstone Horizons RPG include:

* An NPC Encounter system for generating NPC's during your adventure and engaging in short, thematic social encounters with them.
* A Companion system for generating your own Hero Companions, similar to Allies, but powerful enough to count as fully capable Heroes in your solo adventures. This allows you to reduce the book-keeping of solo campaigns by supplimenting a single vanilla Hero with Companions that are mechanically much simpler to manage and track.
* An overworld Hex map generation system for randomly generating your own overworld maps, including dynamically explored OtherWorld maps.
* A system for generating and playing Fights on large custom tiles and battle-maps. 
* A modified "Open Adventure" system for generating and playing adventure missions that extend outside the boundaries of a confined dungeon-crawl structure, allowing missions to take you to more remote and varied locations anywhere in your game world.
* New "Travel Encounters" to expand and replace the existing Travel Events system.
* Adjustments to several existing vanilla systems to make your persistent settlements less brittle and subject to wanton destruction compared to the vanilla experience.
* Mini-games which offer short and fun divergent experiences from the normal skill-check system during some Encounters.
* Heaps of oracle tables to help assist in role-playing, adventure creation, and campaign design.

Each of the above modular systems have been designed to be easily modified by you, rules-light, fast-playing, and as cheap to implement as possible without requiring much labor. I hope you find at least some of Brimstone Horizons as enjoyable to play as I have in creating it!

# Overworld Mapping
Mechanically, the overworld mapping system described here does not add much to the existing Travel Phase in the vanilla game of Shadows of Brimstone. Traveling between two locations is still played out as a series of random travel events that happen along the way. 

Horizons does not feature travel mechanics such as expanded travel actions, camping, survival and food tracking, movement and terrain systems, time tracking systems, etc. Instead, the thematic implications of these ideas are incorporated into the existing Travel Encounters that happen randomly. 

The only gameplay purpose served by generating a hex-map representation of your overworld setting is for determining the number of Travel Encounters rolled, and (if using the optional Travel Encounters module) aligning the terrain depicted on your overworld map with the matching terrain categories of Travel Encounters. Everything else is purely for the fun of generating maps and having a visual reference of your Heroes' travels.

## Hex Map Generation
Hex maps can be generated all at once, partially, or on-the-fly as you play. Fully generating an overworld map at the very beginning of a campaign makes sense when role-playing Heroes that are already quite familiar with the local geographical area in which you start. Alternatively, you may want to leave a few hexes un-explored and some of the settlements partially un-determined, simulating a rough familiarity with the local geography but not complete knowledge.

Generating hexes on-the-fly as you explore makes the most sense when traveling to OtherWorlds that are not native to your Heroes. This small change in procedure can be surprisingly effective at providing a sense of exploration into the unknown with very little additional rules overhead.

If you are undecided as to how you want to start, why not let fate decide?

**Starting World Geography Knowledge Table -  (1d6)**

| **Roll** | **Starting Geographical Knowledge** |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Born and Raised: *Start with full knowledge of the region. Generate all hexes, Settlements/Towns, and Town Locations* |
| 3-4 | Informed by the Locals: *Leave a few hexes un-generated but with borders drawn. Generate Town names, but leave some Town Locations and Traits un-determined.* |
| 5-6 | The Outlanders: *Start with no knowledge of the region. Generate a starting hex, leave the rest of the maps un-explored.* |

### Hex Map Size
The recommended maximum size of a hex map in Horizons is comparatively small at 5x5 hexes. As a result, each individual hex represents a large area, about 20-30 square miles, and may contain a varity of locations and terrain types. Keeping the total number of hexes small allows us to stick very close to the vanilla game mechanics when determining the number of random events encountered during the Travel Phase. On a 5x5 hex map, a typical trip from an adventure back to a town will only be 2-3 hexes, with the longest trips possible crossing a total of 4 hex boundaries. It also helps to ensure that the Travel Phase doesn't take up significantly more time than in the vanilla game.

I've included a printable 5x5 hex map template, or you can go hand-drawn hexes on blank paper (a ruler is recommmended). I've also created a template if you would like to design and print "re-usable" pre-generated hexes. This allows you to create your own library of re-usable hexes, print and apply them to cardboard or foam-board backs, and then shuffle and draw hexes randomly to place on the table.

### Modified Travel Phase Rules
The suggested rules changes in Horizon RPG is only slightly modified from the original game. Of course, players should modify these rules to their hearts content to suit your needs. But you may not want to go overboard and add so many additional mechanics that you end up re-creating an existing fan expansion like HexCrawl!

**Travel Phase Steps**
1. **Determine Destination:** Pick your destination from your current hex on the map. Count the number of hex borders crossed to reach the destination. This will be the travel distance. For each hex border crossed connected by roads, roll 1d6.

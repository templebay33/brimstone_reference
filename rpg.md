# Brimstone Horizons RPG
Brimstone Horizons RPG is a fan-made expansion for Shadows of Brimstone (Flying Frog Productions) which introduces light-weight role-playing elements into the existing sandbox style adventure mechanics of the official game. While similar fan-made expansions have already been produced (HexCrawl, Alone in the Shadows of Brimstone, Brimstone Adventures, etc.), Horizons takes an approach using a "lighter touch", sticking much closer to the vanilla experience. New mechanics are introduced sparingly in an effort to prioritize simplicity, flow, flexibility, and pacing of a campaign. 

Another goal of designing Horizons was to keep the necessity and cost of printing additional components low. While fan-made, digitally distributed content is essentially "free", the costs often involved in large print-and-play projects can easily rival or exceed top-tier, "all-in" Kickstarter pledges of new official content. While some of the *optional* modules offered by Horizons do require printed components, an emphasis has been placed on reducing the need for this where possible. This rule book for example is maintained both in PDF and in Markdown formats for easier viewing and searching on portable devices. 

Aside from being composed of modular elements, features of Brimstone Horizons RPG include:

* An NPC Encounter system for generating NPC's during your adventure and engaging in short, thematic social encounters with them.
* A Companion system for generating your own Hero Companions, similar to Allies, but powerful enough to count as fully capable Heroes in your solo adventures. This allows you to reduce the book-keeping of solo campaigns by supplimenting a single vanilla Hero with Companions that are mechanically much simpler to manage and track.
* An overworld hex map generation system for randomly generating your own overworld maps, including dynamically explored OtherWorld maps.
* A system for generating and playing Fights on large custom tiles and battle-maps. 
* A modified "Open Adventure" system for generating and playing adventure missions that extend outside the boundaries of a confined dungeon-crawl structure, allowing missions to take you to more remote and varied locations anywhere in your game world.
* New "Travel Encounters" to expand and replace the existing Travel Events system.
* Adjustments to several existing vanilla systems to make your persistent settlements less brittle and subject to wanton destruction compared to the vanilla experience.
* Mini-games which offer short divergent experiences from the normal skill-check system during some encounters.
* Heaps of oracle tables to help assist in role-playing, adventure creation, and campaign design.

Each of the above modular systems have been designed to be easily modified by you, rules-light, fast-playing, and as cheap to implement as possible without requiring much labor. I hope you find at least some of Brimstone Horizons as enjoyable to play as I have in creating it!

## Narrative Writing Style
You'll notice that the writing style used for narrative descriptons of encounters, missions, and other RPG elements is vague and simple. The reason for this is not laziness, but intentionally non-specific so that you can fill in the details yourself to make your world your own. Instead of describing the details of what happens during an encounter, simple nouns and verbs are given as keywords so that you can fill in the rest in such a way that it fits within the context of your story. I tend to use a combination of three different approaches when building narrative detail inspired by the random events of the game.

The first is to take charge of the narrative myself. If you are using Horizon, chances are you're playing Shadows of Brimstone more like a TTRPG than a strategy game. Especially if you are playing solo, it's important to remember that there is no such thing as cheating! Whenever you have an idea that excites you "...if THIS happened instead...", it's a sure sign that you are going to have more fun by temporarily borrowing the reigns of control from the dice and steering your story in a direction that makes it more fun. This includes not only filling in the details of vaguely written events, but completely changing the nature of the events themselves.

The second is to make use of the age old tool known as oracle tables. These are simply tables you can roll dice against to select random options from, decks of cards you can draw from for random options, and similar tools. Don't want to decide for yourself what kind of flora you encountered and decided to try eating? Create an "Edible Flora" table and let the dice decide. Horizons includes an entire chapter full of Narrative Oracle Tables that might be of interest specific to the settings of Shadows of Brimstone.

The third and newest kid on the block is generative AI. At the current time of writing in Auguest of 2023, AI models have already become impressively adept at role-playing. Simply asking an AI to act as a narrator during your campaign and feeding in the vague details of your gameplay is all that is needed for what is often creative and well-written material. The more information you provide an AI about the lore and settings of your world, the basic rules of the game, and the style of narration that you desire, the better the result. A lot of the content provided by Horizons was itself assisted by AI.

# Companions
Companions are generated by picking a class, rolling for their two abilities, and then rolling on a level-up chart whenever they gain a level. During the campaign, they do not acquire new gear or abilities, keeping them simple to manage in comparison to the Hero. Of course as with anything in your campaign, you should feel free to modify as you see fit. But the design principle behind Companions was **not** to buld adventuring partners that are as deep and interesting mechanically as Heroes, but rather partners that feel roughly equivalent to Heroes in their capabilities while drastically simplifying the cost in "fiddlyness" to manage them during play. 

Companions are designed to be treated like Heroes for purposes of difficulty scaling. So if your campaign consists of a single Hero and 2 Companions, you would draw from the Medium Threat deck during play and be given a single Revive Token.

While Companions are designed to be mechanically simple, they don't need to be limited at all in terms of role-playing and narrative during your adventures. A primary goal of the Companion system is to free up the players' mental focus from being spent on book-keeping to leave more room for role-playing.

While Companions were always intended to be used more for solo play, there is no mechanical reason why they cannot be used for multiplayer adventures or campaigns.

## Companion Restrictions
Companions have most of the same gameplay restrictions as allies, but there are a few things they can do which Allies cannot. Here is the list of their restrictions, and a separate list of things they can do in comparison to Allies:

### Companion Restricitons
- May not earn XP
- May not equip new Items, Gear, or Artifacts
- May not visit Town Locations
- Does not participate in Town Events
- Does not participate in Town Location Events
- Does not participate in Town Hazard Events
- Does not gain Injuries, Madnesses, or Mutations

### Companion Differences Compared to Allies
- Roll to Move like Heroes
- May get Critical Hits like Heroes
- May use Grit like Heroes
- May Draw Loot Cards like Heroes
- May Explore like Heroes (Scavenge and Look through Doors)
- Included in Random Hero Encounters
- Treated as Heroes during Travel Events
- May carry a default of 5 Side Bag Tokens

## Injury, Madness, and Mutations

For simplicity sake, Companions do not gain Injuries, Madness conditions, or Mutations. Instead, they accrue *Scars*, *Trauma*, and *Blight*. Whenever a Companion would gain an Injury, Madness, or Mutation like a Hero, they simply increase their current number of equivalent Scars, Traumas, or Blights on the Companion Sheet and follow the normal rules for Recovery if they were KO'd, or returning their Corruption to zero after gaining a Blight.

Each time a Companion increases their Scars, Traumas, or Blights, they then check for permanent death. This is done by first rolling 1D6. If the result is *below* the current level of Scars/Traumas/Blights, they are in the grip of death. The companion must then make one final Willpower roll on a 1D6. If they fail, they die. If the first roll is equal to or above the current number of Scars/Traumas/Blights, no final Willpower roll is required.

Scars, Traumas, and Blights can be healed by any game effect that would normal heal an Injury, Madness, or Mutation. When this is done, decrease their current number of Scars/Traumas/Blights by one, to a minimum of zero.

## Companion Creation
Creating a new Companion is simple:

1. Select the Companion Class
2. Randomly select two Abilities from their Ability Chart, re-rolling duplicates.
3. Create a Companion Sheet copying their starting Level 1 information and their two abilities.
4. Give them their starting Side Bag Token(s).
5. Name your Companion!

A printable PDF has also been provided with a blank Companion Sheet if you would like to use it. I like to keep a handful of them laminated and use dry-erase markers.
## Companions Leveling Up
Companions do not earn XP. Any XP gained by a Companion is ignored. Companions "Level-Up" whenever the Hero in the Posse does. If there are multiple Heroes in the Posse, all Companions will Level-Up at the same time as the lowest level Hero. If Leveling Up during an Adventure, Companions reset their Wounds, Sanity, and Grit just as Hero does.

When gaining a Level, make a 2D6 roll and consult the table below, updating the Companion Sheet with their new benefits:

**Companion Level Up Chart - 2D6**
| Roll | Benefit |
| ---- | ------- |
| 2 | +1 To Hit Melee or Ranged (your choice, To Hit 3+ max). If both already max, re-roll.|
| 3 | +1 Defense or Willpower (your choice, 3+ max). If both already max, re-roll. |
| 4, 5 | +1 Move. Increase Health AND Sanity by D3 (roll for each). |
| 6 - 8 | +1 random Attribute. Increase Health/Sanity (any mix) by D6. |
| 9, 10 | +1 Max Grit. Increase Health AND Sanity by D3 (roll for each). |
| 11, 12 | +1 Combat/Shots (your choice, max 5 each), or +1 Initiative. |

When determining a random Attribute to improve, use the following table:

**Random Attribute Table - D6**
| Roll | Attribute |
| ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Agility |
| 2 | Cunning |
| 3 | Spirit |
| 4 | Strength |
| 5 | Lore |
| 6 | Luck |

All Companions use the same table above when gaining a level. Companions **do not** earn new class abilities when leveling up.
## Companions Gaining Resources
Unlike Allies, Companions *may* Scavenge, Explore, participate in Encounters, draw Loot Cards, and earn Gold, Dark Stone, Gear and Artifacts during an Adventure. Companions may also earn other resources from some expansions such as Scrap and Tech in the Blasted Wastes. XP gained by Companions is ignored.

### Companion Resource Usage
Companions will "spend" **all** the resources (Gold, Dark Stone, etc.) they have accrued during each Town Stay. How this is performed is detailed later. Any additional resources that were not spent during the Town Stay or given to a Hero character via *persuasion* (explained later) are permanently removed from the Companion and considered to have stashed in their "retirement fund".

### Companion Side Bag Token Usage
Companions may also carry Side Bag Tokens and the players may decide how they are used at any time just like a normal Hero. Companions will spend their time during a Town Stay replenishing their Side Bag Tokens using the Gold, Dark Stone, and other Loot they accrued during the previous Adventure. More on this below. 

Whenever a Companion would accrue additional Side Bag Tokens but have already reached their max token limit, the players may decide which tokens are kept and which are discarded. In additional, the player may decide other Companions or Heroes with available capacity to be given the dropped Side Bag Tokens. If there is nobody in the Posse with available capacity to pick up the dropped token, the token is lost/discarded.

### Companion Gear and Artifact Usage
Companions **never** equip Items such as Gear or Artifacts, preferring the comfort and familiarity of their own valuables. Such Items gained by a Companion are sold for their Sell Value during a Town Stay. The resulting Gold is then used by the Companion to purchase Side Bag Tokens as described later on.

* Any Gear or Artifact with no Sell Value is sold for D3x$25 by the Companion during their Town Stay. 
* Gear that is immediately discarded for Side Bag Tokens are used the normal way and the Companion will keep the resulting Side Bag Tokens if they have available capacity.


## Companions During Town Stay
After all Town Events and other events are resolved during the **first day** of a Town Stay, each Companion will sell everything they have gained in Town except for Side Bag Tokens. The amount the Companion gains from each item sold is:

* Dark Stone: $50/token
* Gear: Sell Value (D3x$25 if none)
* Artifact: Sell Value (D3x$25 if none)
* Scrap: $10/token
* Tech: $50/token

The resulting pool of Gold is then spent on the following list of priorities. The Companion will always start at the top item in the list and purchase it if enough Gold still remains in their pool, or move to the next item below if they cannot afford it. The Companion will continue this process until they have spent as much Gold as possible or if they have no additional capacity to purchase more.

| Cost | Item | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
$200 | Heal Scar Attempt | 1D6: 1-3: Fail, 4-6 Success. Reduce Scars by 1. Skip if no Scars.
$200 | Heal Trauma Attempt | 1D6: 1-3: Fail, 4-6 Success. Reduce Trauma by 1. Skip if no Trauma.
$250 | Heal Blight Attempt | 1D6: 1-3: Fail, 4-6 Success. Reduce Blights by 1. Skip if no Blights.
| $ ? | Side Bag Token | See Companion Class Side Bag Priorities.

Each Companion class has a unique priority list of Side Bag Tokens specific to their class which they will purchase.

All remaining Gold the Companion has left is discarded after purchasing. 

After spending their Gold, Companions no longer participate in the rest of the Town Stay. They do not visit Town Locations or participate in Town Events. For gameplay purposes, Companions are considered to have "left Town" once they are done spending their Gold.

## Persuading Companions to Share
While your Companions have their own self-interests and desires for what to do with all that adventuring loot, it is possible for Hero's to persuade them to hand some of it over considering the shared trials and dangers across your adventures.

Each Hero in your Posse may attempt to Persuade each Companion in your Posse once per Adventure and once per Town Stay. A persuasion attempt may be made during an Adventure at any point except during a Fight. A persuasion attempt during Town Stay may be made before the Companion sells their acquired loot for Gold.

Before rolling dice for a persuasion attempt, the Hero **must** declare beforehand what kind of Item is being ask for. The Hero can request **one** type of Item per persuasion attempt from the following list:

* Dark Stone
* Scrap
* Tech
* Any single Gear Card
* Any single Artifact Card

When a persuasion attempt is made, the Hero picks any of their 6 skill attributes (Agility, Luck, etc.) to use for the test. The Companion being persuaded will also use the same attribute during the test. 

Both the Hero and Companion then make a 4+ skill check using the chosen attribute. Every success rolled by the Companion is used to cancel out one success of the Hero. If the Hero has any successes remaining, they may "spend" those successes to take loot from the Companion. The number of successes required to take a particular Item is shown below:

| # of Successes | Item |
| --------------: | ---- |
| 1 | x2 Dark Stone Tokens |
| 1 | x3 Scrap Tokens |
| 1 | x1 Tech Token |
| 1 | 1 Gear/Artifact with Sell Value = $0 - $395
| 2 | 1 Gear/Artifact with Sell Value = $400 - $795
| 3 | 1 Gear/Artifact with Sell Value = $800+

If a persuasion attempt fails to procure at least one of the Item requested (any amount of Dark Stone, etc.), the Companion has decided not to give away the Item under any circumstances and will be sold during the next Town Stay.

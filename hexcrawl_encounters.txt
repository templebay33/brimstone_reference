Welcome back again to this update and expansion to the HexCrawl Shadows
of Brimstone™ homebrew variant. I want to thank all the members of the
BoardGameGeek Brimstone community that have contacted me since the first set
of HexCrawl material went out with words of support and encouragement. This
took quite a bit longer than I intended, but was spurred on by the release of the
fantastic Frontier Town expansion. It was impossible to not see the potential for
HexCrawl there along with some other ideas for an expansion and update.
Much Thanks to Flying Frog Productions for their work in producing
Shadows of Brimstone and all the great expansions that have been following.
Here’s looking forward to what Adventures await.

Shadows of Brimstone™ is the intellectual property of Flying Frog
Productions®. The HexCrawl map is based off of the excellent work
of the awesome illustrators at FFP. HexCrawl is a non-commercial,
fan-made expansion.
Text, design, and layout of HexCrawl by Graeme Henson. Special
Thanks goes out to all who commented on the Shadows of
Brimstone BoardGameGeek forums for helping to brainstorm ideas,
provide feedback/critiques, and generally provide an audience for
such a crazy idea in the first place. Commenters included: Angelus
Seniores, Dennis Schwarz, Vadim Golembo, Gavin Downing,
Bernie Roessler, Johnny W, Julien Le Jeune, Elliott Harding, Richard
Wagoner, kell zilla, Darrin, C B, Herb Leist, Chris Seidler, Annie
Heim, Greg Romans, and Klutz among others. Some awesome
individuals contributed to proofreading: Targanth Phelandir, Dwayne
Hendrickson, Ricardo Alaimo, and others. Many of the ideas for
the HexCrawl campaign were also generated by Kevin O’Mara,
while Mike Daneman suggested the simplification for the movement
system. Additional support from Louis K. Barrera for Town Build
mechanics. There were many, many others that have directly or
indirectly contributed to HexCrawl and if they are not mentioned
here it is because of my own faulty memory and is purely
unintentional. Suffice to say, I did not and could not have done this
without the BGG community helping out.
The Devil, John Moulton is an excellent Weird West story game written
by John Wedig of Teapot Dome Games.

Most images pulled from Wikipedia Commons, some sketches
illustrated by Tony Oliver. Most other images are pulled from Flying
Frog Productions own Shadows of Brimstone artwork, most notably
from Brandom Gilliam & Ralph Horsley.
Depictions of Native Americans are intended to fit within the Old
West genre, sometimes from the perspective of Euro-Americans.
Often times these two groups came into conflict and the Euro-
American settlers that came and took tribal lands looked down upon
the Indian tribes they were stealing from, whom they viewed as
“savages”. No offense is meant towards Native Americans in any of
the depictions herein, I’m simply trying to present a gritty, Old West
feel to the game by avoiding whitewashing history, though nothing
in this is based off of any particular historical events.
Many of the ideas for the Wilderness Encounters were based off of
forum threads and fan-made resources from Pinnacle Entertainment’s
Deadlands: The Weird West, a Savage Worlds campaign setting:

HexCrawl is an expansion to Shadows of Brimstone™
that takes your Adventures out from the Mines and Other
Worlds that the Heroes are used to exploring and out into the
wild, untamed region around the ruins of Brimstone. Heroes
will be able to travel around these lands and visit new Towns
in search of lucrative Jobs and dangerous Missions.

Set Up
How To Use This Book
The Encounters Book is used in conjunction with the
rules presented in the HexCrawl Adventure Book, although
you can still use these encounters alongside your vanilla
games of Shadows of Brimstone, but many of the encounters
listed within won’t make as much sense without being able to
travel on some kind of Overland map.
Random Hex Diagram
A number of Encounters or Jobs will reference the
Random Hex Diagram. Use this or simply pick an adjacent
spot to the originating hex, roll a D6 and count out clockwise
around that hex to determine a random direction.
Due to the nature of HexCrawl, this game is geared
towards players wanting a more long-term campaign
experience, possibly with some RPG character building added
in. Depending on the campaign style the group decides to
go with, the Posse may want to begin in a Town, rather than
starting right off on a Mine Adventure. You can either roll up
randomly on the Town Chart or just pick a Town to start in.
When the starting Town is decided upon, the group will
also want to go through the Town Setup process (see the
‘Frontier Towns’ section later on for more info). However,
you may want to give the group some starting gold if
beginning a campaign in a Town, otherwise just begin a
Mission as normal.

DiagramJOBS BOARD (D100)
The Jobs Board is used while in Town when looking for extra work. Not everyone is always going out on Epic Missions
down in nightmarish Mines looking for Dark Stone all the time, are they? Life still goes on above ground and people need to
make ends meet. These can range from mundane, yet strangely dangerous, manual labor Jobs all the way up to deliveries, hit
contracts, bounties, negotiations, and can sometimes lead into Missions themselves. Be careful though, as sometimes Mandatory!
Jobs will appear that you will be forced into and must complete or suffer the consequences of Failure. Jobs are halfway between
short encounters and full-fledged Missions and provide the Heroes with opportunities to travel around the map and get stuff done.
TERRAIN ENCOUNTERS (12:D20)
Terrain Encounters are rolled for when Heroes perform the Search action while on an Overland Map Hex. After the Posse
Searches, they’ll draw an Exploration Token and if it’s an Encounter, Encounter 2x, or Growing Dread Encounter, they’ll have
a Terrain Encounter. Terrain Encounters will be a bit more thematic and match up with the Posse’s position on the map, you’ll
look up the type of Terrain the Posse is situated on and roll on the relevant Terrain Encounter Chart. These could also be used in
place of Wilderness Encounters if you wanted to, though it’s not recommended.
WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS (D100:[100])
Wilderness Encounters were included with previous versions of HexCrawl and they’re still here (with slight tweaks here and
there). These are similar to Travel Hazards you might roll in the vanilla game of Shadows of Brimstone, but these add slightly
more depth and can sometimes have simple branching paths depending on how the Posse decides to proceed. The Wilderness
Encounter Charts are broken up between the Wilderness Encounters themselves and the Wilderness Encounter Results.
5JOBS BOARD
Heroes may now visit the Jobs Board to look for what are mostly short-duration mini-missions that take place on the
Overland map, though some may be more time-intensive than others. The Short Story campaign style requires that the Posse
complete Jobs in order to move the story along, though in the Mine Blast campaign, they’re not required. Some Jobs may even
lead into Missions on their own, while others will take place as optional conditions that can be completed alongside other Jobs
and/or Missions.
Choosing Jobs
Each Town will have three Jobs posted at a time, the
Posse may select one of those Jobs if they want or pass on
all of them without repercussions unless the Job is listed as
‘Mandatory!’ in which case the Posse MUST take on that Job.
The Posse as a whole may only take on one Job at a time, but
may quit a Job and pick up a new one at any time. Any Jobs
that are quit are failed and their ‘Failure’ result occurs.
Heroes may view the Jobs Board at any time during a
Town Stay. Jobs are chosen at random by rolling a D100
(2D10), consulting the Jobs Board and selecting from the
number rolled plus or minus one. So if you rolled ‘20’, you
would be able to pick from Jobs 19, 20, & 21. Once a Job is
accepted, the Heroes are bound by all the conditions of that
Job and if the Job is dropped, it is failed. Mandatory! Jobs
must be taken regardless of what else is available.
Care should be taken when selecting Jobs. If you have
a choice, be sure to note each Job’s Location and Time
Limit, as some Job’s may be nearly impossible to successfully
complete depending on where you’re located on the map.
There’s no sense picking up a Job you know you’ll fail and
then having to deal with the Failure consequences. Also note
the Town where you pick Jobs up from. In some cases the
Jobs will refer to an “Originating Town”, this is the Town
where you originally got the Job and sometimes Reward/
Failure results will have an impact on that Town.
Job Listings
Each Job listing provides information relevant to the Job
at hand. When selecting Jobs, it will be important to review
what the requirements are for each Job, such as the Location
you need to travel to and what, if any, Time Limit there is
on the Job. You should try to only select Jobs that you have a
chance of successfully completing, otherwise if you later have
to drop a Job or fail to complete it, you will have to follow
the ‘Failure’ results listed in the Job’s listing.
#The number rolled using D100
TitleVaguely descriptive title that may or
may not clue you in as to what to
expect from the Job.
KeywordsKeywords related to the Job. Jobs
with the ‘Mandatory!’ keyword
indicate that you have automatically
picked up the Job and must
complete it successfully or you must
deal with the Failure result.
BackgroundFlavor text that briefly summarizes
what the issue is
LocationThis indicates where the Posse will
need to travel to in order to attempt
the Job. Some Jobs occur at Towns,
others at Mines, and still others will
simply give directions to a general
Terrain type or hex:
Completing Jobs
Jobs with a Time Limit will require the Posse to make
use of the Depth Track to keep track of how much time they
have left. If a Job has no Time Limit, you can ignore this.
Place a marker on the number indicated by the Job’s Time
Limit, then move the marker one space forward for each day
that passes. When the marker reaches the Darkness Start space,
the Time Limit is up at the end of that day and in most cases
the Job is failed.
Local Town: The current Town the
Posse is located in.
6
Random Town/Mine: Roll D20
on the Town or Mine Chart to
determine which Town or Mine the
Heroes need to travel to for the Job.
This should be done after the Job is
chosen, not before.Location
(cont.)
Random Clue Site: You will need
to travel to a space a certain distance
away to Search for Clues.
< > Hex: This will usually list a
specific type of Terrain that the
Heroes will have to travel to and
Search or perform some other action
on to progress with the Job. Unless
otherwise specified, you can only
Search or do whatever you need to
on those types of hexes to complete
the Job.
<Location>+<Location>: To find
this Location, start from the first
<Location> listed, then follow the
<Location> directions after that. This
will usually indicate a number of
spaces to go after that, which will
sometimes require you to use the
Random Hex Diagram to determine
where that hex is.
Time Limit
The number of days that the Posse
has to complete the Job. Some
Jobs will have an ‘Immediate’ Time
Limit, in which case they start
right away in the current Town the
Heroes are in.
DescriptionThe specific directions the Heroes
will need to follow in order to
attempt the Job.
RewardThe reward result the Heroes
will find if they complete the Job
successfully. Each Job’s ‘Description’
should detail what is required of the
Heroes to get a Job’s reward.
FailureThe Failure result if the Posse does
not complete the Job within the
specified Time Limit or the Heroes
trigger some other Failure condition
found within the Job’s ‘Description’.
Dropping a Job before it is done
will also trigger a Job’s Failure result.
7
Job Rewards
In most cases, the Heroes will need to travel back to the
Originating Town (the Town where the Heroes got the Job in the
first place) in order to pick up their rewards, though if it makes
sense to you that you would get the reward at your current
location, then by all means collect your reward there.
Dropping Jobs
The Posse may opt to quit a Job before it is done with it,
but if the Posse quits the Job, it must follow the Failure results
given in the Job’s listing. In some cases, nothing will happen,
in others there will be consequences for the Heroes’ failure.
Jobs & Missions
While some Jobs may lead directly into Missions, these
Missions are specifically attached to your current Job and
don’t count against any limits on the number of Missions you
can pick up. Each Town only has one Mission available at a
time, regardless of any Jobs you’ve taken on. You may pick
up a Mission and still have a Job active at the same time and
you may complete these in any order. Each Job or Mission is
considered a separate Adventure, so completing either will end
an ‘Adventure’ for the purposes of timing, even if you are still
actively involved in the other Adventure.
Exploration Tokens
Exploration Tokens are used with Jobs similarly to how
they are used down in the Mines when exploring new rooms.
However, there are some differences in when you would
shuffle the Overland Exploration Tokens:
1) You start a new game session,
2) You start a new Job,
3) Whenever you transition between using
the Overland map & any Map Tiles,
4) Whenever you run out of unrevealed
Exploration Tokens.Jobs Board

to free those people that are being held there (use a
Terrain or Town battlemap). If none of the Fallen Forts
have a Gate icon from the Search, then the rumors
turned out to be just that... rumors.Upon defeating the slavers,
the Heroes free some
townsfolk that were being
held against their will to
mine. While they’ll never
truly recover, they can at
least live out their lives
in freedom. For selflessly
coming to the aid of these

the Heroes move, this token will move two spaces in a
random direction (roll a D6 and use the Random Hex
Diagram). If it ever reaches a Town, the Blackfangers
have launched a raid and will decimate this Town and
its inhabitants.For successfully putting
down the Blackfang
Indian War party, the
Heroes each receive 30
XP and worth of
Dark Stone, in addition to
whatever Loot they find
off the Indians.If the Blackfang token
reaches a Town, that Town
is Destroyed and remove
the Blackfang token
from the board. Each
Hero in the Posse takes
Corruption Points
(ignores Willpower) from
knowing the horrors that
befell those townsfolk
while they did nothing
to stop it. You careless
bastards should be
ashamed of yourselves.
If the Heroes move onto a hex with any of these
Strangler figures, remove all these Strangler figures
from the map and Attack! The Heroes will fight as
many Strangler as were removed from the map on an
overland terrain battlemap. If you run out of Strangler
figures before they reach a Town or are fought, remove
all Strangler figures and the Job is failed.
To stop the token the Posse needs to engage this
raiding party by intercepting the token. Upon reaching
the token, the Heroes immediately begin a Fight on a
Terrain battlemap against either a
worth of Indian
Human Enemies or an Epic Level Threat’s worth of
Blackfang Indians (whichever Enemies are available).

If the group wants to avoid re-killing the townsfolk’s

convince each Hungry Dead to get back into their graves.
While adjacent to 1 or more Hungry Dead, any Hero
may attempt to talk them back into the grave by making
a Cunning 5+ or Spirit 5+ roll. If successful, that Hungry
Dead will stop attacking and move to Escape from the
battlemap. Heroes may only attempt to convince each
Hungry Dead twice, after that you have no choice but to
kill the Dead that won’t listen to reason.#

14 daysTo help garner support for the candidate, the Heroes
need to travel around the area surrounding the Town
and try to generate support for the candidate. To
convince voters you’ll need to make appeals to their
intellect (Cunning 6+ test), their patriotism (Lore 5+
test), intimidate them into voting correctly (Strength 5+
test), or just bribe them with money and/or alcohol.
In each hex where you’re trying to build support, you
may spend 1 MP to try to influence the locals there.
You’ll need to sway 6 hexes to vote for the candidate to
complete this Job. You only have one chance to sway
each hex, otherwise it goes for the opposition and you
may not try to sway that hex for the rest of the Job.
Place a marker on hexes to keep track of those for or

Place a Void Twister token on the Random Mine. At
the start of each day the Void Twister will travel 5 hexes
in a random direction (use the Random Hex Diagram).
If the Void Twister hits the edge of the Map, it finishes
out its movement going back the way it came. If it
passes over a Town, it will Destroy 2 Random Town
Locations. If the Void Twister ends its turn directly on
a Town hex, that Town is Destroyed.For each Town that the
Posse is able to warn
about the Void Twister,
each Hero gains
5 XP and $25 from the
grateful townsfolk.There is no set Failure
result for this Job.
When the Heroes get to Town they immediately get
Ambushed by a High Human Threat’s worth of
Enemies. These Enemies all have the keyword ‘Tribal’.
You may use the Capture action on the Indians instead
of killing them. See ‘Expanded Combat’ for rules on
Capturing.If the Heroes are
successful in driving off
the Indian raiders, they
each gain 30 XP and
D3x$50 from the grateful
townsfolk.Any Hero with the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ that kills
any of the Indians, loses that keyword. Any Hero that
does not have the keyword ‘Tribal’ that kills any of the
Indians, gains the keyword Paleface.If none of the Indians are
killed during the Fight
then the Heroes have
earned the respect of the
local Indian populace for
not shedding the blood
of these rogue Indians.
Each non-Tribal Hero that
has the keyword ‘Paleface’
loses that keyword and
also gains the keyword
‘Kemosabe’.If the Heroes are
unsuccessful in driving out
the Indian Raiding party
before the week is up, then
the Indians go on one last
massive raid, pillaging and
burning as much as they
can find. This Town has
3 Random Locations
Destroyed before the
Indians leave Town and
the area for better pickings.
The Heroes may try to coax the walking dead back
into the ground, but they aren’t being particularly
threatening to anybody. Heroes will need to visit each
Town Location and attempt a Cunning 5+ test to try to
talk them back into their graves. Each Hero may make
the attempt, but if two Heroes fail this test in a row,
the dead at that Town Location refuse all attempts at
logic and won’t go back to their graves. You need two
successes in order to clear a Town Location.For each Town
Location that the Heroes
successfully clear, each
Hero gains 10 XP and
$25. If all the Town
Locations are successfully
cleared, each Hero may
buy one Purchase Item
or Service from anywhere
in that Town at a 25%
discount (to the nearest
whole $, rounded down).
If the Heroes are able to get to a Town hex first and
warn the townsfolk there (free action), then they
can mitigate the disaster and those Towns that are
warned gain Armor 3+ to protect themselves from any
destruction while the Void Twister is active. Roll a D6
whenever a Town or Location would be Destroyed, on
a 3+, that Town or Location is not Destroyed (Armor
ends after this Job is over).
In addition to the above, Holy Heroes may attempt
an exorcism on the Town to banish the spirits of the
dead back to the afterlife. A Holy Hero may attempt
a series of three Spirit 6+ tests or the Posse as a whole
can try to make a series of three All Hero Spirit 4+
tests (choose one, cannot attempt both). If two out of
the three tests are passed, then the walking dead are
successfully exorcised from the Town, though now
everyone has to re-bury all these corpses.

will need to make a Cunning 5+ test over the course
of a few days in Town. Only one Hero may make this
test per day (though you may switch off who takes the
test each day). Beginning at $90, for each success the
price of Train Tickets will reduce by $10 from the Rail
workers request in wage increases. For each success
made with a ‘6’ or better, that price is instead reduced
by $25. The minimum you will be able to go to is $30.

negotiate down the

The Mutants have gathered together at this Town (either

have contracted the Plague (roll once on the Madness
Chart and -2 Health permanently).
In order to help save the Mutants, the Heroes will need
to get in enough medical supplies to relieve the Mutants
before this outbreak spreads and gets out of control. To
control the outbreak, the Heroes will need to transport
in a number of healing Side Bag Tokens equivalent to

Town, they will need to bring in 16 (2x8) healing Side

The Posse will need to attempt to negotiate with either
the wealthy Investors or the Indian tribe to try to find
some kind of peaceful resolution to this, otherwise the
Indian tribe on that land will surely get wiped out by
wealthy Investors looking to exploit that property.
To Negotiate with the Indians, the Heroes will need
to travel to the Indians’ sacred land and attempt to
convince them to leave peacefully. They will need
to either make two out of three Solo Spirit 5+ tests
(‘Tribal’/’Kemosabe’ Heroes get +1 on these rolls) or
may try to Intimidate them by fighting their bravest
warriors: Attack - Roll a Human Threat (all Enemies
have the ‘Tribal’ keyword).
To Negotiate with the wealthy Investors and to try to
convince them to look elsewhere, the Posse will need
to make a trip to their offices in their Town. They will
need to either make two out of three Solo Cunning
5+ tests (‘Frontier’ Heroes get +1 on these rolls) or the
Posse may try to Intimidate them by roughing up their
bodyguards: Attack - Roll for an Epic Human Threat.
If the Heroes successfully
bring the Plague under
control in this Town
before it gets a chance
to spread they are hailed
as miracle workers. Each
Hero gains 50 XP. In
addition, the Posse as a
whole is compensated
with twice the amount it
cost them to buy supplies.
For example, if the Heroes
bought 16 bandages
($50 each) to heal a size
8 Town, they would’ve
originally paid $800. If
successful in healing the
Town, the Posse would
gain a total of $1600 as a
reward.
If the Heroes peacefully
negotiate with the Indians,
then they each gain 25 XP
and $100.
If the Posse successfully
beats the Indian warriors
and intimidates them into
leaving, then they each gain
50 XP and $300.
In either case, non-Tribal
Heroes lose the ‘Kemosabe’
keyword and gain the
‘Paleface’.
If the Heroes successfully
negotiate with the Investors,
they each gain 25 XP and
lose 1 point of Corruption.
If the Posse successfully
intimidates the Investors,
they each gain 50 XP and
lose D3+1 Corruption.
In either case, non-Tribal
Heroes lose the keyword
‘Paleface’ and gain
‘Kemosabe’.

If the Heroes fail to
control the outbreak, the
Plague spreads beyond just

The Hero that completed
this Job gains 25 XP x
their Hero level.
The Heroes must enter into the Mine and go on a
Search Party Mission [Basic:4]. However, each Clue
Icon that the Heroes find on this Mission is one of the
Adventurers they’ve gone in to find. After any Fights or
Encounters have been dealt with when finding a Clue
Icon, the Heroes should roll to see if each Adventurer
is still alive (see ‘The Third Clue’ Objective for more
information). Any Adventurers that are still alive will
travel with the Posse in the Mines as Allies until the
end of the Mission (add a model to represent each
Adventurer), but can still be killed.
Use the following stats for the Adventurers:
No Combat actions available
Move 4
Health 4 (Def 4+)
Sanity 5 (Will 5+)
Any Wounds or Sanity damage that affects
the Heroes during Encounters, also affects the
Adventurers.
If the Heroes successfully
complete the Job, they
gain 60 XP. For each
Adventurer that the
Heroes rescue alive out
of the Mine, each Hero
gains $50.
For each Adventurer that
is not rescued, each Hero
suffers D3 Corruption
Hits, as the guilt of their
failure to rescue their
comrades stings their pride.
For every two Adventurers
that are rescued alive, each
Hero may gain either +1
Health, +1 Sanity, remove
D3 Corruption, or draw
a Gear card.
If any Adventurers don’t
make it out alive, read
from the Failure result
as well.
The Heroes will need to find a total of 4 Adventurers
on this Job. Any Adventurers not found before the
Heroes leave the Mine are assumed to be Dead.

1) Blow the Dynamite Side Bag Token on the tracks.
One Hero needs to make a Cunning 3+ test. If a 1 is
rolled, that Hero takes D3 Wounds, ignoring Defense.
Each Hero may attempt this as long as you have
Dynamite. As long as at least one Hero succeeds, the

each day draw an Exploration Token. If a Clue Icon
is revealed, any number of Heroes may devote their
next day in Town to investigating that Clue. Instead of
visiting a Town Location, each Hero that is investigating
must make a Cunning 5+ test and if at least half the
Heroes investigating succeed on this test (rounded up),
the Heroes have tracked down a lead. The Heroes must
successfully track down 3 leads in this way in order to
successfully find the Killer.If the Heroes are

is Destroyed.
On a large Overland battlemap or the Town battlemap,
place two sets of High Level Human Threats at either
end of the battlemap and place the Heroes in the center.
The Posse must make an All Heroes Cunning 5+ test
to see how well they can play the two gangs against
each other. For each success, remove one Enemy from
both of the gangs. After the test is finished, if there are
any Enemies left, the Heroes fight whoever is left. All
Enemies will attack the Heroes, having realized their
deception they band together just long enough to take
you bastards out.If the Heroes are

Town traits if necessary).
You’ll need to ride a train on the rail line to encounter
the Hell Train and exorcise it from the tracks. Each time
you ride on the rail line, draw an Exploration Token,
but ignore all results from the Tokens apart from Clue
icons. When you come across a Clue icon, you have
found the Hell Train and have a chance at trying to
exorcise the foul engine.For clearing the tracks of
the Hell Train the Posse
gains 35 XP and a wealthy
railroad baron rewards the
Posse generously with a

may travel for free along
the rail line any time they
travel from the town that
originated this Job.
Upon finding the Killer, the Heroes must then engage
in a fight with a single Brutal Human Villain two levels
above the Posse’s Threat level.
The group must travel to the Mine and begin a Hive
of Scum & Villainy Mission [HexCrawl:1] to find the

same Map Tile automatically takes 1 Horror Hit.
Immediately Destroy one Random Town Location in
the affected Town. The Heroes must travel to the Town
and engage in a fight against an Epic Level threat. Begin
the Fight on a Town or terrain battlemap and place a
Gate tile on the opposite, middle side of the board. This
Gate is considered adjacent to the edge of the battlemap.
To close the Gate the Heroes need to defeat all Enemies
on the board.
While in this fight, make a Hold Back the Darkness roll
each turn. Each time this roll is failed, draw a Low
Threat card and add those Enemies around the Gate.
To defeat the Hell Train, the Posse may attempt to
either perform an exorcism by making three consecutive
All Heroes Spirit 5+ tests or by tossing dynamite into
the Hell Train. One Hero needs to make a normal
Range attack to toss the Dynamite in and each Hero
only has one chance per encounter to toss Dynamite.
You’ll need to do a total of 10 damage to the Hell Train
to destroy it. If a 1 is rolled on a Range attack roll, you
have blown up your own train and derailed it.
If your train is derailed, each Hero takes D8 Hits and
place the Posse midway between towns on a Railroad
hex. That section of Railroad that the Posse is also out
of service until the end of your next Adventure.

TitleTERRAIN ENCOUNTERS
Terrain Encounters are rolled up depending on the the type of terrain the Posse is located above. So if the group is on a
Forest hex, they would roll up a Terrain Encounter from the ‘Forest Terrain’ table, or on a Mountain on the ‘Mountain Terrain’
table, and so on and so forth. While these are meant to be used in the game differently than Wilderness Encounters, your group
might opt to use these in place of the normal Wilderness Encounters, though there’s likely to be more flipping back and forth
in the book to find the right tables.
Wilderness vs Terrain Encounters
Wilderness Encounters are checked for at the beginning
of each day before the party begins its movement for the day.
Terrain Encounters, on the other hand, come up when the
Posse is Searching on the Overland map and come across
one of the Encounter results (Encounter, Encounter x2, and
Growing Dread Encounter) on the Exploration Tokens. While
Wilderness Encounters pretty much happen to your group
whether you want them to or not, Terrain Encounters are
slightly more intentional in that the Posse has some degree of
control, though not much, over what types of encounters they
run into. You may find some terrain more hospitable than
others, though Growing Dread Encounters are always bad.
SEARCHING
Revealing Exploration Tokens
When moving on the Overland map,
make sure the pile of Exploration Tokens
is kept shuffled. When a Search action is
performed (1 MP), take note of the terrain
that the Heroes are currently on and take
the top Exploration Token off the pile to
determine the results of that Search. The
Heroes can only Search each individual hex once per day,
but may Search multiple hexes while moving throughout a
single day. The Exploration Token results are similar to what
happens while out on a Mission with some key differences.
Note that there are a few situations in which you would
shuffle the Exploration Tokens: 1) you start a new game
session, 2) you start a new Job, 3) whenever you transition
between using the Overland map & any Map Tiles, and
4) whenever you run out of unrevealed Exploration Tokens.
Door/Gate Icons
Door and Gate Icons are used for some Jobs
and may be used to determine whether an Attack
is against Monster or Human Enemies,
but are otherwise ignored while
Searching on the Overland map.
Encounters
If an Exploration Token with the
‘Encounter’ result is revealed, roll one
Encounter from the matching Terrain
Encounter Chart. If the ‘Encounter
x2’ result is revealed, roll up two
Encounters from the matching
Terrain Encounter Chart instead.
Attacks and Ambush Attacks
If an Exploration Token with the
‘Attack’ result is revealed, the Posse
gets into a Fight! If an Exploration
Token with the ‘Ambush Attack’ result is
revealed, the Heroes have been ambushed!
All Enemies gain +2 Initiative during
the first turn of the Fight. Consult the
section on ‘Overland Combat’ for more
information on how to set up these Fights.
Growing Dread Encounter
If the Growing Dread
Exploration Token is revealed, roll on
the ‘Growing Dread’ section of the
Terrain Encounter Chart, regardless
of what type of terrain the Posse
is actually currently on. In some
campaign styles, additional results
may occur as a consequence of a
‘Growing Dread Encounter’ result
being revealed.
Clue Icons
Clue icons are used when the Heroes are on
a Job. Frequently these will require the Heroes to
find X Clue icons in order to progress or finish
the Job. Consult the Job description for more
information about how Clue icons are used.

07	The Sun Dance
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Tribal
Long before you see them, you hear the steady throb of the drums. On a low
rock outcropping, an Apache shaman and a dozen acolytes are swaying in trance
as they dance around a post. Talon’s are skewered into their chests, as they lean
backwards, held above the ground by their tearing skin and taunt leather cords.
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Water
Some black magic has tainted the Posse’s water. The horses are stumbling and
the group struggles forward, to a shimmering line of blue in the distance.
Every day each Hero loses D6 from their Max Health until the Posse
travels to a hex containing water or an undestroyed Town. As soon as the
Heroes have traveled to a safe hex, their Max Health is restored, though
their current Health remains at the lowered level until they are Healed.
The Shaman is performing a ritual to drive back the Darkness, and
it affects all who have been touched by it, including the Heroes! Any
Heroes carrying Dark Stone may either drop the Dark Stone they are
carrying (it shatters and is lost) or they must roll for Corruption for each
Dark Stone, item with a Dark Stone symbol, or Dark Stone Upgrade that
they carry.

definitely wasn’t there before...
Cunning 5+
You manage to start up a basic dialogue with these travelers using hand
gestures. They are traders from a distant land that have somehow ended
up here in this desert. They offer to sell you some strange trinkets in
exchange for some gold and information about this area. Draw 3 Mine
Artifact cards, you may Purchase each Artifact for double the Sell value
listed on the card.
The Posse immediately begins an Overload Mission [Targa:5]. Re-roll if
you do not own City of the Ancients. Upon completing the Mission, the
Posse returns to this same Overland map hex.
10	The Sand Snake
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
If unsuccessful, neither group can make out the other and the caravan
rides on without incident.

sand. Suddenly it rears up, a cloud of dust forms around it as it twists and flails
creating a whirlwind. The whirling Sand Snake moves towards the Posse…

If the Posse moves again this day, each non-Tribal Hero in the Posse
becomes Cursed and is -1 Max Grit until they can have an Exorcism
of Madness Ritual performed at a Church. The Exorcism is performed
as usual but removes this Curse instead of removing any Madness. Any
Hero with the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ loses that keyword, while any Heroes

immediately regret it as his tale of madness and depravity unnerves even the

Strong winds here have blasted some sand dunes away, revealing what appears to

The Posse may immediately begin an Exploration Mission [Basic:2],
otherwise, nothing eventful happens.

Each Hero makes a series of D6 rolls, as many as it takes until at least
one Hero rolls a 1. If a Hero rolls a ‘6’ during this time, that Hero gains
15 XP, recovers 1 Grit, and may stop rolling. The first Hero to roll a ‘1’
takes D8 Horror Hits and everyone stops rolling at that point. If no one
rolls a ‘1’, then the encounter is over.
As you pass through this wooded area, you can hear the sounds of small,
laughing children all about you. Some are singing what sounds to be a nursery
rhyme in a language that you’ve never heard before. While it starts off low, it
gradually begins to overpower your senses.
Each Hero in the group takes 1 Sanity Damage, ignoring Willpower. For
the rest of the day, each Hero suffers an additional 1 Sanity Damage each
time you enter a Forest hex.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Monster
With a muffled crash, a tree falls in the distance causing a cloud of squawking
birds to fill the air. Something massive is making it’s way towards the Posse!
If the Posse does not move at least 2 hexes away within the same day,
they are ambushed by a single XL Enemy in a fight on an Overland
battlemap. This XL Enemy has +D8 Health, does +2 extra damage, and
has 2 Epic abilities no matter the level of the Posse. Each Hero draws
two Loot cards if the Monster is defeated.
To right this most terrible wrong, you may stop movement for the day
and spend the next D3+1 days in this area helping to rebuild this tiny
Town that you so mercilessly trampled over. If you spend the time, lose
D6x$25 helping to rebuild, but recover 1 Grit. If you decide not to
help, take D3 points of Corruption (no Willpower save) and along with
another D3 Corruption Hits.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Explore
8	Dire W olves
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
A blinding flash and the ancient forest is transformed for a moment into a land
of black and white lines. High on a hillock howl a pack of dire wolves, each
rivaling a horse in size. They appear to be hungry.
For the remainder of this day, you may ignore any ‘Attack’ or ‘Ambush’
results you get when performing an Overland ‘Search’ action. However,
any Clue Icons or Encounters that trigger a Fight are unaffected.
Each Hero makes three rounds of Attacks (Melee or Ranged). If a Hero
does not do at least 5 Damage between all of their Attacks (Wolves have
Defense 0), their Mount is Killed.
4	Move with Caution !
Encounter Environment Hazard
The forest around you is filled with interesting karst caves and clay tunnels. In
some places, the ground is very ready to collapse and dump the heroes into the
wet clay pits below.
Encounter ◆ Active
You walk through the forest, marveling at the age and size of some of the trees
in this part of the forest, when underfoot you hear faint cries of horror from
men, women, and children. You look below upon the devastated ruins of a
miniature town. As you raise your boot, you see to your horror stains of red and
tiny humanoids clinging for dear life onto the soles of your boot, some falling
many inches to their death. Some brave souls mount a counterattack against your
monstrous incursion into their small town, but to no avail, your destruction of
their once peaceful way of life is utter and complete.
2	The Sleeper Awakes
A small company of US cavalrymen have ridden into this area in search of
Outlaws. Knowing the danger around these parts, they offer to let you ride along
with them for the remainder of their mission here.
W here Giants Tread
9	The Ancient Flame -Leaf
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Ancient
A burning tree stands apart from the other trees, the flame never wavering or
dying. As you approach the tree, a voice older and angrier than anything you’ve
ever heard before booms out from all around you. The ancient tree accuses you
of trespassing and demands a sacrifice from you.
For the rest of the day, the Posse rolls a D6 whenever they enter a hex.
On a roll of 1, the Posse falls into one of the pits and must go directly
into an Escape Mission [Basic:5] to exit the caves. If any Heroes in the
Posse have the keyword ‘Scout’, they may avoid this Mission if they want.
Each Hero must sacrifice 1 Dark Stone or an item with a Dark Stone
icon. Any Hero that fails to make an offering to the Flame-Leaf gains a
Curse ‘Fire-blood’. Whenever a Hero with ‘Fire-blood’ takes a Wound
from any source, they also take 1 Sanity damage with no Willpower save
and are -1 Initiative per Wound.
5	Mama Grizzly
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
While wading through undergrowth the Posse stumbles across a family of bears
at play. It all happens so fast. The cubs look at you - eyes wide. The horses smell
the bears and revolt running for their lives. The mother bear rears up on two
legs, roars, and gives chase.
This Curse can be removed at a Church Town Location using the
Exorcism of Madness ritual. The Exorcism is performed as usual but
removes this Curse instead of removing any Madness from the Hero.
The Posse must immediately move in a random direction using the
Random Hex Diagram (does not count against Overland movement for the
day) or else a Random Hero loses their Horse. If the Random Hero does
not have a Horse to lose, they roll on the Injury Chart instead.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Merchant
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Beneath a thick canopy of trees in the middle of the forest, you find a ramshackle
log cabin run by a pair of brothers. One is crippled from the waist down, the
other is blind. Despite their handicaps, they have a wide range of useful things
for sale.
You may buy Purchase Items from here as if you were at a Frontier
Outpost Town Location (do not roll for Location Events).
11	Stone Trees
Some Outlaws have just robbed a Frontier Outpost bank and are carrying money
in assorted bills and coins as they make their way back to their hideout.
If you choose to rob the Outlaws, begin an Overland battle against a
group of

Outlaws, gain
x$100 from the Outlaws’ ill gotten gains. Otherwise, the
Outlaws continue on their way and make off with the loot.
17	The Ancient Gates
Encounter ◆ Environment
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Mission
As you start to search the area, the Posse finds a set of massive gates, overgrown
with moss, vines, and bushes. This appears to be the site of an ancient complex
that once stood here. While any other structures that once stood above ground
have been worn away, you find an entrance that leads you down below into the
bowels of the earth.
Nothing eventful happens.If you decide to explore underground, stop all movement for the day
and immediately begin a Exploration Mission [Basic:2]. Standard Rules,
Rewards, & Failure conditions apply.
12	Hanging Dolls
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Darkness
Hanging children is beneath contempt, but words escape you when it comes to
hanging babies. Upon closer inspection though, it appears to be a tree covered
in children’s’ dolls hanging from every branch. Bones of some small animals and
even some bigger ones litter the base of the tree. There doesn’t seem to be a wind
in the air, but those hanging dolls are moving as if there was...
The Hero with the most Dark Stone and/or items with Dark Stone
symbols is attacked! That Hero must roll against D6 Escape tests
(Escape 3+). For each Escape test that they fail, that Hero takes
1 Sanity Damage with no Willpower save.
18	No Sign of Life
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Explore
A little ways off the path, an abandoned campsite can be seen. The tents are
in tatters, flapping in the wind, the packs and crates ransacked. No sign of the
occupants, dead or alive…
Each Hero may make a Scavenge roll to determine if anything is found.
If any of the Heroes roll a 1 or if no Heroes succeed on the Scavenge
roll, then none of the Heroes find anything of value.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Monsters
Before you can react, you all find yourselves caught in a series of spiderwebs.
The more you struggle, the more it seems to attract the Void Spiders that have
made their home here!
Agility 4+
Any Heroes that successfully pass this test may go back to help another
Hero that failed their Agility test (that Hero may reroll their test, each
Hero may only be helped once), but the Hero that is going back must
immediately roll another Agility 4+ test. Those that fail this test must roll
once on the Injury Chart.
You think you may have read about them in school books when you were a
child, but overhead you catch sight of some monkeys, swinging from branch to
branch. For a time you’re struck by how adorable they look, until you realize that
the entire Posse is surrounded by them. Their eyes glow red and one monkey,
twice the size of the others, stands up on it’s hind legs and bares his teeth at you.
If the Posse decides to stand their ground, each Hero takes D8 Hits from
the swarms of monkeys attacking them. If the Posse decides to flee, each
Hero makes an Agility 5+ test. If failed, that Hero loses a Random Gear
Item in the confusion of their escape.

14	Lumber Camp
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Explore
A group of brawny men are busy cutting down trees in this part of the forest.
They don’t pay you much mind as the work they’re doing looks strenuous
enough. As you’re about to leave this area, horrible cries erupt from deep in
the woods where a group of lumberjacks had been walking to. The Heroes find
a grisly scene of carnage as body parts and blood are splashed about in equal
measure. Something butchered these men with little remorse.
The next time an Exploration Token is flipped while in this hex or any
adjacent Forest hexes, draw an additional Threat card with 2 Epic abilities
and begin an Overland battle in addition to whatever else is on the
Exploration Token.
15	Trap Poachers
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
You fall victim to some sort of trap and a group of Hunters pop out. They were
trying to catch some vicious wolves that have been raiding the area. There is a
bounty on every wolf tongue - which can also be used to pay taxes.
The Posse loses half their Move Points (rounded down) for the day as
they get themselves sorted out and the Hunters insist on paying you back
with drinks for your trouble.

A friendly Indian Shaman is out collecting herbs and hails your Posse. He
advises you of what he’s seen just a few miles away on his way here.
Select an adjacent hex and flip over an Exploration Token. If you Search
that specific hex on this day, draw the face-up Exploration Token.
Otherwise draw from the next face-down Exploration Token for any other
hexes that you Search this day. Reshuffle all the Exploration Tokens at the
end of the day.
Terrain Encounters
This part of the forest is filled with petrified trees, though some craftsman appears
to have gone through and carved hideously deformed faces on each and every
one of these trees. The workmanship is amazing as it appears as though those
horrible stone faces are following you no matter where you walk. You might
never live to know how that was accomplished.MINE TERRAIN
D20
Mine terrain refers to any hex that contains a
Mine entrance.
01	Leaking Mine
Terrain Encounters
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Mission
05	People Trap
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard
This Mine appears to leaking some sort of dark black, oily substance. The stuff
seems to be toxic to plants and animals, so it might be best if you shut it off at
its source.As you search around the Mine entrance, one of the Hero’s legs becomes trapped
in some sort of mechanical contraption. The Trap must be a way for some foul
monster to catch themselves some food!
The Heroes may immediately go on an Exploration Mission [Basic:2] to
find the source of the leak in the Mine and fix the problem. When the
Heroes find their first Dead End Room and have defeated any Enemies
there, they have found the source of the leak here and can fix it. If the
Mission is failed or not taken, the dark black substance continues to leak out
and poisons the local water supply. A shop owner is killed and his business
falls into ruin. Destroy 1 Random Building from the nearest Town.A Random Hero becomes trapped and takes D3 Hits.
Cunning 6+
If successful, gain 30 XP and the trapped Hero is freed. If failed, that
Hero takes another D3 Hits. Each Hero may attempt the test. If all
Heroes are unsuccessful, Ambush! - Draw a Threat. The trapped Hero
will be unable to move during this Fight. After the Fight, if the Posse is
victorious, the trap releases and the Hero may move freely again.
If successful, each Hero gains 30 XP and finds D3 Dark Stone nearby.

Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ ExploreEncounter ◆ Active ◆ Attack
As you poke around the area, the ground beneath you suddenly gives way! You
all fall down into a cavern beneath the ground, with no clear way to crawl back
out. You appear to be in the middle of a network of caves, maybe one of them
leads back up to the surface?Ambush! - Draw a Threat card

Terrible things burst forth from the Mine entrance and have you surrounded!
07	Illuminated Lady
Encounter ◆ Supernatural

one hand and nothing but her other hand to cover the rest of her body. She
beckons you closer to come feel her warmth.

immediately begin an Escape Mission [Basic:5] in this Mine to get out.
All normal conditions apply.
All Male Heroes: Spirit 5+
03	Grasping Hands
Those that fail run headlong after the Woman, unmindful of the dangers
and disappear into the Mines after the Woman. They appear minutes later,
frenzied and half-mad, each rolls once on the Madness Chart.
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Death
You cautiously poke around near the entrance of the Mine, your gaze at
full attention on the Mine entrance lest something pour forth and catch you
unawares. As you walk along, suddenly your foot gets stuck. You quickly look
down to see a skeletal hand wrapped firmly around your ankle!
08	Lady in Distress
Encounter ◆ Exploration ◆ Rescue
Agility 4+
A beautiful woman in a tattered dress with tears streaming down her face cries out
to you from the Mine entrance. Something unseen behind her pulls her back in.
If successful, gain 20 XP. Each Hero that fails this roll takes D6 Horror
Hits as they try to fight to get their feet free of these skeletal hands.
The Heroes may immediately go on a Search Party Mission [Basic:4]
to attempt to rescue the woman. If the Posse chooses not to, they suffer
D6 Corruption Points (ignoring Willpower), as their cowardice weighs
heavily on their souls. Each Hero’s reward for rescuing the woman is
$100 and +1 Sanity.
04	Noxious Odor

dead. It’s as if a demon were using this Mine as his own personal pit latrine.
Strength 5+
09	Ghostly Prospects
Encounter ◆ Supernatural
Those that fail are -1 Defense until the end of your next Adventure.
You’ve just about searched the area and are headed out when you turn back
around and where there was just nothing a second ago you now spy a group of
spectral figures all staring out at you. They look to have once been miners, their
spirits now stare coldly out at the living through empty sockets, Their sense of
hatred towards the not-dead is palpable and you feel their cold icy gaze stabbing
you in your brain.
Each Hero must immediately spend 1 Grit or take D8 Horror Hits.
4010	Nightmarish Echoes
16	Gold Droppings
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Supernatural
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Loot
You call out into the Mine and hear your own echoes somehow distorted. Your
own voice reverberates back to you and echoes within your skull. It’s become
changed and alien, despite being your own. Try as you might to distract yourself
from the sound, you can’t shake it and it begins overwhelming you.
Each Hero in the Posse takes D6 Horror Hits. If more than half the
Posse takes Sanity Damage from this, the Posse is routed and you flee in
terror. Move the Posse 1 hex using the Random Hex Diagram (does not
count against your movement for the day).
Amongst some clumps of grass just outside the Mine entrance, you spy
something shiny!
You discover some nuggets of gold that somebody dropped here,
most likely pulled up from the Mine long ago before Dark Stone was
discovered. The Posse finds gold scattered about the area totaling
x$50, to be split equally among the Posse.
17 “B y the Skin of Our Teeth ”
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
11	Echoes
Encounter
You call out into the Mine and hear only echoes. Your mind wants to fill in the
gulf with the roars of terrible monsters or the moans of the hungry dead, but
there is nothing but silence. It’s unsettling, but peaceful. In another time you
wouldn’t have thought anything of it. You relax your grip on your pistol just a
little bit, it seems all clear for now.
12	Terrifying W arning
If the Posse makes Camp at least one hex away from this Mine today, you
camp down with the Adventurers for the night. Each Hero gains 30 XP. If
at least one Hero gives up an alcoholic or herbal Side Bag Token, the Posse
gains an additional Revive token as well for use on their next Mission.
18	Souvenirs
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Darkness
A crude, handwritten sign has been nailed to one of the beams along the
entrance to the Mine. In a dark, brownish script it reads, “here men die.” The
rough letters look to have been written by an animal, but what animal knows
their letters?
The next time you start a Mission, add a Growing Dread card to the
stack immediately.
13	Scarab Swarm
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature ◆ Swarm
A swarm of large, iridescent beetles pours out of the mouth of the Mine. Their
mandibles produce a slight spark, which appears as a crackling light coming
from this swarm. They fly right through the Posse, getting into every nook and
cranny and crevice. Some of the little buggers seem to have even developed a
taste for some of the supplies you’re carrying with you.
Luck 4+
Those that fail the test must discard a Random Side Bag Token. If the
Token discarded is Dynamite, roll a D8. If a 1 is rolled, the Dynamite is
ignited by the beetles sparking mandibles. All Heroes take D6 Wounds
(no Defense).
14 W histling Melody
Encounter ◆ Strange ◆ Hope
From the opening that leads down into the Mine you hear somebody whistling a
queer melody, yet it somehow seems to fill your hearts full of courage.
Each Hero recovers 1 Grit.
15	Drunk Old Coot
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
An elderly prospector wanders out of the Mine with a thirsty look in his eye and
the strong smell of urine, booze, and vomit emanating from his unwashed body.
He asks if you might spare him a drink.
If the Posse gives up an alcoholic Side Bag Token, the old coot warms up
to you and tells the Posse a riveting story about his younger days of glory
when he was adventurer, before he took that damn arrow in his knee.
Each Hero gains 20 XP and recovers 1 Grit.
41
Encounter ◆ Stranger ◆ Loot
Some enterprising miners have set up shop outside this Mine. Despite the dangers
in these Mines, they occasionally make trips down into the Mines to pull up
whatever treasures they can find and are ready to make a deal.
Roll a D6 to determine what the miners have for sale:
1-4

the card.
19	Abandoned Mine Cart
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Loot
Someone seems to have left a mine cart out here on a track. On top are a bunch
of piled up rocks. There’s a big boulder on top that’s pretty heavy, but just
underneath you think you might see some Dark Stone!
Strength 5+
If any Heroes fail this test, the boulder comes crashing down and a
Random Hero rolls once on the Injury Chart. Regardless, each Hero gains
25 XP and 1 Dark Stone after the boulder is moved.
20	Local Map
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Loot
As you poke around the entrance to the Mine, you see a scrap of paper fluttering
behind a hidden alcove. You move the rock out of the way and uncover what
looks to be an old map. Some old prospector must’ve drawn this map years ago
and hid it here.
The next time you enter this Mine on any Mission, you gain the Old Map
Gear item.
Terrain Encounters
Nothing eventful happens.
Another group of Adventurers bursts out of the Mine, kissing the ground in front
of you and looking at the Sun like a long lost family member. They try to go
through their tale, but adrenaline is still coursing through their veins and they can
barely construct any sentences that make any sense to you. Maybe if you could
calm them down somehow you might get something worthwhile out of them.MOUNTAIN TERRAIN
D20
Mountain terrain includes any hexes with obvious hills,
cliffs, plateaus, or any other mountain-esque things.
1	The Mountain Pass
7	Spider Hole
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Enemy
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Explore
A lonely mountain pass is guarded by a horde of Enemies, denying all passage.
As you search along a particularly steep side of a rocky area, you see what
appears to be a small freshly dug hole, hastily covered with a flat rock. As you
uncover the hole, something emerges!
Unless the Posse fights a High level threat, you must stop all movement
for the day as you search for another way around this group.
Each Hero gains 25 XP. Roll a D6:
2	Rock slide
Terrain Encounters
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard
A few pebbles bounce by at first, without anyone paying attention, but when the
mountain’s face begins to slide, all bets are off.
Roll 2D6. Collectively, the Heroes must take that many Hits, but may
decide how those Hits are distributed amongst the Heroes. You have one
minute to decide or all Heroes each take that many Hits.
3	Hot Feet!
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Fire
The ground about you begins to rumble as you realize that you appear to be
on a dormant volcano that has once again become active and is about to start
spewing lava!
Agility 5+
A giant spider jumps out from the hole as you rip off the
covering and attacks. Each Hero takes D3 Wounds (no
Defense) before you’re able to kill the thing.
2-5An odor of death & decay hits you full force as you lift the
covering. You find mutilated bodies, fresh kills for some
creature that thankfully isn’t around. Each Hero takes
D3 Horror Hits as they realize that the cuts are actually
intricate carvings of some demonic symbols.
6A frightened Prospector arises from the hole. He had been
hiding from a swarm of monsters and gives the Heroes what
he thinks attracted the monsters in the first place. Each Hero
receives 1 Dark Stone and recovers 1 Grit.
8	Viper ’s Nest
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
Any Hero that fails has lost any Boots they were wearing, unless the
Boots provided some kind of resistance or immunity to Fire effects.
One of the Posse members needs a private moment with nature. An unfortunate
back-step and they are reaching for their drawers as they slide down a flue.
None of this is as surprising as the rattle-snake nest they’ve fallen on.
4	The Price of Corruption
Agility 5+
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
If successful, gain 20 XP and you are unharmed. If failed, you have
become Poisoned! Gain D6 Poison markers. For each of these Poison
markers that you have, roll a D6 once per day. On a 1 or 2, take 1
Wound, ignoring Defense. On a 6, you may discard a Poison marker.
If it weren’t for the time of season the little log cabin would never be seen by the
Posse. This would probably have been for the best, for there now stands before
you a man with a sawed-off shotgun, accompanied by wolves and a great bear.
If the Posse collectively has more Corruption points than the # of Heroes
x 2, then the Mountain man and his animal allies attack you! Each Hero
takes D6 Hits and rolls a D6. On a roll of 1, that Hero has lost 1 Dark
Stone, an item with a Dark Stone icon, or an item with a Dark Stone
Upgrade attached (your choice).
9	Good Eatin ’
Encounter ◆ Active
A tribe of crazed mountain giants have taken up cannibalism and are hunting the
Posse! They’re planning on getting fat off the meat of your carcasses tonight.
5	Fossil Record
Each Hero in the Posse takes D8 Wounds. This damage can be
completely avoided if any one Hero gives up their Horse to be killed to
throw the mountain giants off of the Posse’s trail.
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Loot
A recent landslide has exposed a fossil. The fossil does not appear to be like any
creature you’ve ever seen before, living or dead. Surely a learned fellow would be
interested in having a look at this thing.
Each Hero that can may take one Fossil item (
sold at a Doc’s Office for D6x$50.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
). Each Fossil may be
Looking up through thickening clouds, someone glimpses a huge nest. An
enormous winged shape leaps from the edge of the nest.
6	Gabriel’s Horns
The Thunderbird attacks the Posse! A Random Hero takes D6 Hits. For
the rest of the day, every time the Posse moves into a hex with mountain
terrain, a Random Hero in the Posse takes an additional D6 Hits.
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hope
The Posse travels through a wet mist of low cloud formations feeling
miserable. They are drawn out of their black thoughts when the mountain peaks
begin to sing a sort of song. It’s almost as if the mountain tops are resonating
with some sort of cosmic harmony.
11	Fire in the Hills
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Fire
Each Hero is Healed to Full Health & Sanity.
The smell of smoke hangs in the air and all around you the hillsides are aflame
with an unnatural glow! Lavamen are walking the landscape destroying all they
find. The unnatural flames of the Lavamen burn those tainted by corruption.
42
Each Hero takes 1 Wound (no Defense) for each point of Corruption
they have. Any Hero that takes damage from this also gains 15 XP.12	Mountain Yetis
16	Stairway to the Sky
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Ancient ◆ Tech
A warning grunt turns the Posse’s head towards the lip of a cliff-top. A hairy
head appears. Another head follows and another. Giant, hairy, beast-like men
stare down in silence. One points with intent at you. Then suddenly, rolling logs
and boulders come crashing down the mountainside towards the Posse!
Agility 5+ or
Strength 4+
The Heroes may individually make separate Agility 5+ tests or may
collectively make a group Strength 4+ test (choose one, either everyone
does Agility tests or the Posse does a Strength test as a whole) to either
dodge out of the way or create a quick barrier against the falling debris.
Any Hero that is successful in the Agility test or if the Posse passes the
Strength test, they each gain 20 XP and recover 1 Grit.
If any Heroes fail the individual Agility test, they take D6 Hits. If any
one Hero in the group fails the Strength 4+ test, then all Heroes in the
Posse takes D3 Wounds (no Defense).
13 B urial Chamber of the Dust Pharaohs
Lore 6+
A single Hero may attempt to figure out the inner workings of the device
and get it working again. If they are unsuccessful, the mountain shudders
around them and the rock staircase the party took up is destroyed in a
massive upheaval. The Posse will need to spend 5 MP to climb back
down the mountain from the peak.
If the Hero is successful, the rock around the peak shudders and suddenly
great mechanical parts spring from all around the Posse. The platform
lurches and rises from the peak, held aloft by some alien technology. The
Heroes are flying! This platform may transport the Heroes to any hex on
the map in a single day (do not roll for Wilderness Encounters and does not
count against movement), but falls to pieces after the Heroes land.
What appeared to the Posse as a semblance of man-made structures can no
longer be reasoned to be anything but. An opening along a cliff side seems to
be covered in gold. Inside an enormous cavern of gold, rank-upon-rank of man-
sized urns vanish into the dusty distance.
If you decide to look inside the urns, gain 25 XP and roll D6:
Seepage - While looking through the urns, one of the urns
seems to have been seeping its contents for who knows how
long. A random Hero accidentally touches the substance
and gets an odd, tingly feeling. That Hero gains a Random
Mutation regardless of how much Corruption they currently
have and Corruption is not removed because of this.
2-5Trinkets and Bobbles - Most of what you find crumples to
dust in your hands, but you come across a few small things
that might fetch a good price. Each Hero gains D3x$25.
6Something Interesting - a Random Hero draws a Loot card!
14	Gruesome Sculptures
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Void
Lightning bolts burst against mountain peaks. One bolt strikes directly in front
of the Posse, blinding you for a moment, but it leaves something behind. A
crackling orb of pure white hovers in front of you, bolts of energy shooting out.
Any Heroes that are carrying Dark Stone, items with a Dark Stone icon,
or items with a Dark Stone Upgrade attached take D3 Horror Hits.
If any Sanity Damage is taken, that Hero gains the ‘Fused With Item’
Mutation, but must fuse with an item with a Dark Stone Icon or that has
a Dark Stone Upgrade. Continue to roll for Corruption on that item.
18	Hunting Lodge
Encounter Active Merchant
You come across a well-built cabin up in a remote part of the mountains, a
hunting lodge way up here! The owner has a variety of wares for sale here.
You may buy Purchase Items from here as if you were at a General Store
Town Location (do not roll for Location Events).
19	Remnants of the Great W orm
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Cult
Some old blood cult lurked in the cave that can be seen above this mountain
path. When they departed (or where driven out), their gruesome rack of skulls
and the pylons they built from stacked human thigh bones were left untouched,
grim sentinels along either side of the traverse.
Each Hero gains 25 XP and takes D6 Horror Hits. The macabre display
has the Posse on edge throughout the entire trip. For the rest of this
day and the next, any Attack results from Exploration Tokens become
Ambush Attacks instead.
15	Cavern of the W inds
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard
Making your way around a particularly difficult ridge, the Posse is forced to go
single file, inching along at a slow pace. The way before you opens up to reveal
a small cavern where the wind blows with monstrous strength. The opening is
too small to enter, so you’ll have to go around, but it’s going to be treacherous.
Decide on the order of Heroes in the line and, one at a time, each Hero
makes an Agility 4+ test. If a Hero fails this initial test, the Heroes before
or after them may attempt an Agility 4+ test to rescue them, otherwise
they fall. If any 1’s are rolled on this rescue roll, that Hero also falls and
again, the Heroes before and after them may attempt an Agility 4+ test
to rescue them. All Heroes that fall down the ridge take D6 Wounds (no
Defense). Any Heroes that do not fall gain 20 XP and recovers 1 Grit.
43

Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Disease
7	Cattle Drive
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Something you ate awhile ago isn’t agreeing so well with your stomach and you
ain’t defecated correctly in a number of days. Maybe you should get a doctor to
fix you up or somethin?
A trail boss rides lead in front of a hundred head of cattle. He slows at the sight
of the Posse closing in and grabs for his gun, thinking your heavily armed Posse
to be cattle rustlers.
A Random Hero has contracted an intestinal disease and isn’t doing so
well. You have one week (7 days) to consume 1 Tonic and 1 Herb Side
Bag Token. If you do not, then your Hero is Dead.
Cunning 5+
If successful, then you’re able to defuse the situation and continue on
your way. However, if any Heroes roll a 1, then things get out of hand
over a misunderstanding and shots start flying! The cattle get spooked and
there’s a stampede, throwing everything into disarray. Each Hero takes
D6 Hits and for each Wound they suffer roll a D6. On a 1 or 2, that
Hero loses a Random Side Bag Token.

B ad Beans
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Disease
A member of the Posse crumples over in pain, the remains of last night’s dinner
spilling forth from their mouth. Curiously, nobody else in the group seems to
have been affected by the food.
8	The Embryo
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Alien
You’re stomach is pretty tore up from whatever the hell you was eatin’.
Until the end of the next Mission, you can’t consume any edible Side
Bag Tokens, as you’re like to just puke it back up anyways. It’ll be hard
enough just holding your food down as it is.
The plains are scorched bare. No plant life grows in the area, as if a great fire
had burned all life to a cinder. As you search around a little more, you find what
appears to be an immense blackened crater, at the center of which lies a pulsating
mass of flesh, horrible to behold, and very much alive!
The thing launches a brutal psychic attack against the party. Each Hero
takes D6 Horror Hits, with each undefended Horror Hit inflicting
D3 Sanity Damage.
3	Ancient Battleground
Encounter Environment Scavenge
Scattered across the terrain are various weapons and ancient bones from some
battle fought along these plains long ago.
Any Hero that does not take any Sanity Damage may attempt an attack
against the Embryo to stop it’s powerful mental assault, rolling for either a
standard Ranged or Melee attack (no free attacks; Defense 2). The Heroes
may repeatedly attack the Embryo as many times as they like, however each
attempt brings another attack of D6 Horror Hits (D3 Sanity Damage)
each time. When the creature has taken 10 Wounds, it is destroyed and each
member of the Posse gains 20 XP and recovers 1 Grit.
Each Hero may attempt a Scavenge roll.
4	The Dark Hole
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Pit
In the midst of your search, you come across a great chasm in the earth,
approximately 100 ft in diameter. It doesn’t sound as if there’s any bottom to
this pit, as rocks thrown in never seem to land. As you approach the edge the
massive hole and stare into the abyss, you feel as if something is stirring within.
A swarm of HellBats comes flying up from the depths of the pit, blotting
out the sun with their massive numbers. They don’t attack, instead simply
hovering over the group, creating a feeling of dread and despair. Until the
start of your next Mission, the group is unable to Heal any Wounds or
Sanity due to the constant terror imposed by the dreaded swarm.
Otherwise, if the Posse decides not to attack the thing, they may leave,
but are moved 1 random hex away (does not count against your overland
movement for the day).
9	Cattle Rustlers
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Singing cowpunchers are busy keeping their herd from stampeding. A bull breaks
and runs past the Posse. Someone recognizes the brand, or what the brand ought
to be if it hadn’t been altered. Looks like these are some damn Cattle Rustlers!
5	Prairie Fire
If the group raises a ruckus about it, begin an overland battle against a
Human Enemy Threat at the Posse’s current level. Otherwise if the group
chooses to avoid combat, each Hero that does not have the keyword
‘Outlaw’ takes D3 Corruption Hits knowing that they’re letting some
no-good cattle rustlers off the hook.
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Fire
A massive wildfire races across the prairie - a tsunami wave of burning grass
turning everything in its path to cinder.
The Posse is pushed 1 hex in a random direction on the overland hex
map (use the Random Hex Diagram) and all Move points are used up
for the rest of the day as the Posse takes cover from the wildfire.
6	Prairie Ticks
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Disease
As you travel along, one of your horses suddenly cries out in pain just as
something begins to burst out from the horses side. Fist-sized insects begin to
swarm out as if they’ve been eating their way out of the horse’s belly.
A Random Hero must use 2 Bandage or 1 Herb Side Bag Token or else
their mount will die from the parasitic insects that have chewed open the
Mount from the inside-out.

15 W ild Horses
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Transport
A platoon of Mexican cavalry are riding towards your Posse. You don’t know
what these hombres would be doing this far north of the border. You reckon that
nothing good can possibly come from this encounter.
If any members of the Posse have the keyword ‘Outlaw’, the Mexican
cavalry are here to question them for some prior trouble those “Heroes”
were involved in awhile back south of the border.
Outlaw Heroes: Cunning 5+
Any Outlaw Heroes must make this Skill Test to convince the Mexicans to
look elsewhere or be forced to pay 25% of all their Gold in bribes to get
the Mexican army off their back.
Otherwise, if no Heroes have the keyword ‘Outlaw’, the platoon passes
by without incident.

listen again, you begin to make out the mournful ballad of the wind.

that a Hero takes, they are also -1 to all their Willpower rolls until the end

A group a traveling performers hail your Posse and strike up a conversation.
They’re on their way to the next Town and stop for some gossip and directions,
though a small crowd of country folk begin to form up for a performance.
You may perform any actions or buy any Purchase Items from the troupe
as if you were at a Saloon (including Saloon Girl Only options). Do not roll
for Location Events. Limits are still in effect, this counts as a Visit.
Agility 1–6+
A single Hero may attempt the challenge against the young Indian
Braves by making a series of Agility skill tests. The Hero begins with an
Agility 1+ test, then an Agility 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, and 6+ tests until they have
completed all of the tests.
If the Hero is able to complete all the tests then they gain 15 XP. A non-
Tribal Hero that successfully completes this gains the keyword ‘Kemosabe’.
13	Hell’s Black Tears
Encounter ◆ Environment
Some disgusting, blackish, oily substance is spilling out from the earth and
forming a pool. It’s likely evil trying to escape out from somewhere deep in the
pits of hell. It’s best to blow this thing to kingdom come
Each Hero may use a Dynamite Side Bag Token to attempt to seal the
seepage. Each Hero that is using Dynamite in this way makes a Range
attack and then rolls for damage. If more than 10 points of damage are
done, then the tainted substance is sealed up and each Hero gains
15 XP and recovers 1 Grit. If any 1’s are rolled for the Range attack, then
the Dynamite accidentally creates a fissure that extends into the nearest
Town’s water supply. A Random Building in that Town is Destroyed
from townsfolk driven insane by the fouled water.
14	The Girlish Grin
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
The Posse stops to stretch their legs. A little sod house stands a ways off.
Standing before the home’s entrance, a haggard woman holds the hand of a little
girl. The girl’s grin chills the toughest of souls. In a voice much older than the
small girl that stands before you, the girl demands that you take her on a journey.
An uncontrollable urge compels you to oblige...
The girl demands to be taken to a Town out of your way. Each Hero
must make a Willpower save at a -1. If all Heroes fail their Willpower
save, roll D20 on the Town Chart and the Posse must then begin
traveling towards that Town using the most direct route possible (do not
roll for Wilderness Encounters as usual). Upon reaching the Town, the
girl vanishes and a Random Building in Town is Destroyed.
Otherwise, if any Heroes succeed against the girl’s psychic onslaught, she
lets out a horrific scream that burns your mind. Each Hero gains 15 XP
and takes D6 Sanity Damage (no Willpower save).

Hero suffers any Wounds as a result, roll on the Injury Chart. If a Hero
suffers any Sanity Damage, roll on the Madness Chart.
19	The W hite Buffalo
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Hope
A White Buffalo can be seen approaching the party from a distance. As it nears,
you feel a sense of warmth and friendliness from the great beast that you can’t
quite place. It seems to be leading the Posse towards something.
If the Posse follows after the White Buffalo, you move D3 hexes in a
single random direction (use the Random Hex diagram). The Heroes
must spend Move points in order to get to that location within a day or
two. If you make it in time, then each Hero gains any 2 Side Bag Tokens
of their choice that they could normally buy from any Town Location.

hexes that you Search this day. Reshuffle all the Exploration Tokens at the
end of the day.

6	Dastardly W hiplash
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Rescue
A great white leviathan of a buffalo snorts and lowers its head towards a passing
train it mistakes for another great buffalo.
Some foul fiend has left a fair maiden tied up to a railway line. What
deviousness! You have only seconds to act before a speeding locomotive bears
down upon this buxom damsel in distress.
Terrain Encounters
With a tumultuous crash the Great White Buffalo rams into the train,
sending its cars scattering off to the side of the railway. Until the End
of your next Adventure, all train travel along this section of railway is
impossible until the mess can be cleaned up.
Each Hero may attempt to free the tied-up maiden, however, only
one Hero may be successful. Each Hero that is attempting makes an
Agility 3+ test and counts the number of their successes. All Heroes that
are tied for number of successes are disqualified. The player with the
most successes that isn’t disqualified (not tied and must have 1 or more
successes), has rescued the fair maiden. If no one is successful, the fair
maiden is cut in twain and all Heroes take D3 Corruption Hits (no
Willpower save). Whoever saves the maiden recovers 1 Grit and may

2	Racing the Iron Horse
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Gambling
Someone must’ve made a bet at a train station, as you can see a locomotive
speeding down the track, going neck and neck against an Indian Brave on
horseback. The Train Engineer is giving the train all she has and only God
knows if man or machine will win out in this race.
Each Hero may place bets on the outcome of this race. Everyone that wants
to, secretly bets with a hidden die, even = the Train, odd = the Indian
Brave. Then a D6 is rolled and the outcome determined. Each losing

winning Heroes also gain a Bandage or Whiskey Side Bag Token (choose
one), while if the Indian Brave wins, those winning Heroes Recover 1 Grit.
7	Kraken of the Rails
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Void
A horde of Tentacles have sprang forth from the ground and are literally holding
up a small train off the tracks!
Each Hero makes an Attack (Melee or Ranged). If collectively the Heroes
are able to do at least 2 x # of Heroes worth of Damage (ex. three
Heroes need to do at least 6 Wounds), then they have freed the train from
the tentacles before serious damage is done. If successful, the Heroes
each gain a reward of D6x$25. If failed, then the train along with a huge
section of the railway is Destroyed. Until the end of your next Adventure,
you may not travel by train down this railway to any towns that would be
reached via this section of the railway.
3	Indian Attack!
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Tribal
Smoke billows can be seen up ahead and Indian Braves on horseback throwing
torches are riding around. They’re destroying the railway where it has gone over
sacred Indian territory!

have it, while every non-Tribal Hero that does not have the keyword
‘Kemosabe’ gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Rescue
Some hooligans have chained a farmer’s cow to the tracks. The farmer is busy
trying to free the animal from the tracks, but a speeding locomotive is on a
collision course with both man and cow unless you can act fast!
If you do not stop the Indians, this section of the railway is permanently
Destroyed. You may not travel by train down this railway to any towns
that would be reached via this section of the railway.
Without discussing their choice, each Hero secretly chooses a direction to
pull the cow off the tracks using a hidden die, (even = right, odd = left).
Everyone reveals their choice at the same time. Whichever group wins,
the cow is pulled in their direction off the tracks and each Hero on that
side gains 20 XP. Whichever Heroes were on the other side barely escape
the oncoming train and take
Wounds for their effort.
If tied, then the cow is torn apart by the train and the Heroes collectively
lose
x$50 paying back the farmer for his lost cow (each Hero loses
$50 if a decision cannot be reached).
4	Train Robbery!
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Outlaw
Ahead of you, the Posse spies a passenger train stopped on the tracks, a group
on horseback with guns drawn can be seen in front of the train and the engineer
is standing beside the engine with hands in the air. It’s a Train Robbery!
Each Hero that can makes a Range attack against the train robbers to chase
them away. If less than half of the Heroes Hit with their attacks, the train
robbers put up a fight and each Hero in the Posse takes

themselves. For each roll of 5 or 6, gain 1 Dark Stone without ill
effect. On a roll of 2, 3, 4 a Hero gains 1 Dark Stone, but also gains 1
Corruption Point with no save.
The whistle of an oncoming train can be heard rushing down the tracks. Yet
the train you can see appears to be some faint apparition, a spectral train of
the dead. The train comes to a stop in front of the Posse, an ethereal conductor
beckons you to board the train.
The Posse may travel on this Phantom Train if they’d like to any hex on
the map, but each Hero takes D8 Horror Hits and if they suffer 3 or
more Sanity Damage as a result, roll once on the Madness Chart.
If any Heroes roll a 1, Ambush - Draw a High Threat card.

They offer to let you roll some dice if you don’t mind losing the shirt off your backs.
Each Hero may gamble if they want and places a bet of $50 or $100, roll
2D6. A 7 or 11 automatically wins the game for the Hero, while 2, 3,
or double-sixes automatically fails. Any other result becomes the target
number and the Hero will roll 2D6 again. The Hero must hit the

cigars. It’s a wonder people like that still live and play in a place like Brimstone.A Rail Inspector is walking up the line and stops to chat with your group. He’s
spent some time in the area and saw something no more than a day ago that he
thinks you need to watch out for.
If there are no Heroes with the keyword ‘Law’ in the Posse and at least
one ‘Outlaw’ Hero, you may attempt a Train Hold Up.Select an adjacent hex and flip over an Exploration Token. If you Search

If successful, then the poor stranger is pulled up from the river and
thanks you profusely. Whomever successfully pulls the stranger up gains
D6x$25 and recovers 1 Grit. If no one rescues the stranger, then each
Hero takes D3 Corruption Hits.
If a Hero fails and rolls any 1s in the process, then they get caught up in
the river themselves and will need to be rescued by another Hero who
will need to make the same roll (the same condition applies to all Heroes
who attempt this). Heroes may either attempt to rescue the stranger or
another Hero, but not both.
Those that aren’t rescued will be carried away by the current for a few

Something is moving beneath the water, every so often you catch sight of a scaled
form just breaking the surface. There’s a palpable sense of dread in the Posse
when you think about what might happen if you were to try to cross that river.
If the Posse crosses this river at any point during this day or the next,
you will be attacked by a savage river monster, it’s hunger for flesh and
Dark Stone brought alive by your passing! Each Hero will take

The first Hero to complete both tests draws a Loot card. To determine
who may take the tests first, roll a D6 and add it to their Initiative,

beast carries a lantern and stares intently at you with cruel eyes as it guards what
looks to be a riverside garden of some sort.
Each Hero may have a ‘Conversion’ performed on them for free. This is
the exact same as the Service of the same name that can be purchased at a
Church Town Location.The weird beast charges at the party, out of fear or malice you cannot say.
Each Hero in the party takes
Hits and the thing wades out into the
river and escapes.
If nobody in the party takes any Wounds from the assault, the Nightmare
Ram also drops his intricate Lantern, carved of bone! This Lantern can be
used to make separate Hold Back the Darkness rolls (make two sets of rolls,
only move the Darkness marker if both rolls fail). This Lantern will last
until the end of your next Mission, at which point it crumbles apart.
5	Row Row Row your Boat
Encounter ◆ Water ◆ Transport
The Posse comes across an old boat run aground. The boat still seems to be in

Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard ◆ Water
A group of lawmen and some outlaws have gotten themselves into a shootout,
the outlaws seem to have the upper-hand as the lawmen are pinned down and
can’t retreat with the river at their backs.
You may choose to help either the Outlaws or the Lawmen. If you assist
the Lawmen, the Outlaws are killed and each Hero in the Posse gains 50
XP. If you assist the Outlaws, the Lawmen are killed and each Hero in
the Posse gains D3x$50. If there are any Heroes with the keyword ‘Law’
in the Posse, you must help the Lawmen.
11	The Ferryman
Heavy rains have raised the waters higher than normal and the entire area has
become flooded. Crossing the river will be impossible.
The Posse immediately moves 1 hex away from any River terrain (does
not cost movement). For the rest of the day, you are unable to move onto
any hexes with River terrain.
16	Floating Body
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Death
A corpse, bloated and rotting floats along the river. The body appears to be quite
old and from where you are there’s no way to tell the cause of death.
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Strange ◆ Stranger
You see a figure clad in a dark cloak atop a ferry, their face obscured from view.
The figure stretches out a bony hand, as if waiting for payment. In a gravelly
voice the figure makes the Heroes an offer to forestall their own demise.
12	Men of Stone and Sorrow
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Disease
You stop by the river to get yourself a drink, as you bend down and cup your
hands for some water, you see something strange. At first it appears to be a
statue beneath the water, but it begins to swim towards you at a rapid pace. A
stone figure reaches through the water at you and is trying to pull you under!
Agility 4+
If the Hero successfully dodges the attack, they gain 25 XP.
If failed, this Hero is dragged into the water and becomes infected with
‘Greyscale’, an illness that slowly turns a Hero to living stone! Each week
(7 days) after becoming infected, you get -1 to Initiative, +1 to your
Defense rolls, and roll once on the Madness Chart. After 4 full weeks, the
Hero will die and their body permanently changes into a statue. The only
cure for Greyscale is to be bitten by a Void Enemy. After receiving
1 Wound from a Void Enemy, the effects of the disease are removed at the
end of the Mission (or next Mission if not currently on one).
13	Flash Flood !

14	Deep Hatreds
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Jargono ◆ Creature
A tribe of Serpent men have taken up residence on this part of the river. Though
their features appear misshapen and horrible to behold, they’re not immediately
attacking you. They seem to have the same level of disgust and trepidation
towards you as you do of them.
Each Hero takes D3 Horror Hits. If anybody takes any Sanity damage
from their initial scare, a fight breaks out and each Hero takes D6 Hits.
If nobody in the Posse takes any Sanity damage from this, they see past
the serpent mens’ frightening exterior and begin a dialogue with them.
Heroes may buy Purchase Items from these Serpent men as if they were
at a Jargono Swamp Village (see Klutz’s Jargono Swamp Village on
BoardGameGeek.com for more info).

17	Crossing Troops
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Movement
An army of soldiers have erected a series of temporary bridges in this area to
bring horses and equipment across the river.

the river will be treated as Tough terrain as normal.
18	Ragged Story Teller

Sitting beside the river, an elderly woman dressed in patched gypsy clothing
is washing some clothing, singing a song in a language you can only guess is
European. Nearby you see an immaculately painted vardo and a horse grazing.
The woman beckons you over and without introducing herself begins a story.
The woman weaves a tale of death & destruction, of tragic heroes & loves
lost, of monsters slain and wrongs righted. When she has finished her
story, she turns to a Random Hero and says that the tale she has just told,
was their own future. That Hero gains a personal Revive Token. That
Token may only be used by them and not transfered to any other Heroes.
19	Strange Ice
Encounter ◆ Environment
Inexplicably, the surface of the river here has frozen over, though the temperature
certainly doesn’t warrant that behavior.
For the next day, the Posse may cross over any river hexes as if they were
Easy terrain, however, roll a D6 anytime you cross over the river. On a 1,
the ice breaks and each Hero suffers D6 Hits from falling into the river.
Roll an additional D6, on a 1, that Heroes’ Horse is lost.

The blowing sheets of rain wet your bones through and through. This freak
storm came out of nowhere, but it’s been unrelenting and there doesn’t seem to
be any cover that the Posse can see. The road is becoming flooded and you don’t
think you’ll be able to travel very easily while this downpour continues.
Bloodied bodies hang from the windows and drape the stage coach reigns.
The horses are exhausted with fright and come to a halt in front of the Posse.
Something doesn’t seem right about the situation.
Cunning 5+
For the rest of the day, treat all Roads and Railroad tracks as Tough
terrain instead of Easy Terrain.
Each Hero that passes this test uncovers the mystery and immediately
takes D8 Horror Hits at the sudden realization of what happened on that
stage coach. Any Hero that rolls a 1, also rolls on the Madness Chart and
gains a Madness. The details of the stage coach mystery are so horrific as
to be beyond human understanding, let alone the written word.
03	The Settlers
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Settlement
The Posse comes across a small wagon train looking to make a settlement.
Having heard rumors about free land for anyone that will settle it, they have
packed up all their belongings and starting a new life on the frontier.
08 B leeding Justice
Encounter ◆ Stranger
The Settlers ask you for an escort. If the Posse travels with them, at a pace
of 4 MP per day to one of the edges of the map, each Hero gains 20 XP
and $50.
A US Marshal, tired and dusty, is approaching from the opposite direction. He has a
gunshot wound and is demanding help from you in the name of the US Government.
Stop all movement for the day. If there are any ‘Law’ Heroes in the group,
the Posse must collectively give up 3 Bandages or other Wound-Healing Side
Bag Tokens to Heal the US Marshal. Otherwise, it is optional.
04	Circle the W agons
Encounter Active Tribal
If they don’t have enough or don’t give, then Heroes with the keyword ‘Law’
each take D6 Corruption Points, ignoring Willpower, as they watch him
die. All other Heroes without the keyword ‘Law’ or ‘Outlaw’ instead take D3
Corruption Points with no Willpower save. ‘Outlaw’ Heroes are unaffected
(but must still give up Side Bag Tokens if ‘Law’ Heroes are present).
The Posse barely manages to take up defensive positions within a circle of
homesteading wagons after coming across a pack of Stranglers. The homesteaders
here have been massacred, but you don’t seem to be alone. A group of Indian
Braves have also ended up here and are helping to hold back the fiends.
Strength 5+ or
Agility 5+
For each 6 rolled, an Indian Brave is spared. If successful, then the Posse
and the Indians have managed to hold back the Stranglers until help
arrives and drive the Stranglers off, each Hero gains 30 XP.
If the US Marshal is Healed, then each Hero that participated gains 20 XP
and recovers 1 Grit for helping to nurse him back to health.
09	Highwaymen
Encounter ◆ Fight
If at least 3+ Indian Braves are spared, then these Indians recount your
bravery in the face of overwhelming numbers and each Hero that doesn’t
have the keyword ‘Tribal’ or ‘Paleface’ gains the keyword ‘Kemosabe’. If a
Hero has the keyword ‘Paleface’, then they lose that keyword instead.
If the Posse fails, then each Hero takes D8 Wounds before they’re able to
escape, leaving the Indian Braves to their deaths. Each Hero that does not
have the keyword ‘Tribal’ or ‘Kemosabe’ gains the keyword ‘Paleface’. If a
Hero has the keyword ‘Kemosabe’, then they lose that keyword instead.
The man bows with an exaggerated sweep. His ragged dirty gang members only
scowl. He kindly asks that you relieve yourself of material burdens, for others
have greater need of it, and they won’t be much use to you if you were to die.
Ambush - Roll for a Human Threat at the Posse’s level.

provoke an altercation, especially with how heavily armed your group is.

A stage coach has thrown a wheel and one of the passengers has suffered a severe
wound to the head, if the Posse can lend aid they will be most appreciative.
Any Heroes that wants to may give up a Bandage or any other Wound-

donate a single Side Bag Token for a reward. If nobody donates anything,

has caused some sort of misunderstanding. Their Hero gets shot and
immediately takes

A one horse buggy pulls along side the Posse, and a black clad preacher asks if
he might accompany you until the next town. He has heard rumors that a town
is without a Preacher and he seeks to bring them the Word.
Until you enter the next Town, the Preacher counts as a member of the
Posse with the keyword ‘Holy’. The Preacher will also grant 1 Random
Hero a temporary Aura of Endurance during any overland Fights that
occur while travels with you. This Aura only lasts the duration of the
Fight and the Preacher himself does no participate in Fights.
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Void
At this crossroads, a statue of eerie and unsettling aspect has been erected. It
resembles a robed death, a bent crone, and some kind of snaky tentacle creature,
all rolled into one hunched form. Someone has left for this strange waygod an
offering of a raw haunch of deer, dry and odorous and pecked by birds but new
enough to be untouched by wolves or other creatures.
Any Heroes may give up Side Bag Tokens as an offering to the statue,
then roll 2D6 once on the table. For each additional Token offered
beyond the first, add +1 to the roll. Otherwise, nothing happens if no
offering is made.
2D6Effect

gift as leeches begin to rain from the sky all around you.
Each Hero suffers
Wounds, ignoring Defense, and each
Hero rolls a D6, on a 1 or 2, that Hero’s horse has been bled
to death by the leeches.
The curious figure takes no notice of your meager offering.
Consider his apathy to be a blessing.

by your offering. Each Hero that contributed something
may choose to have any one Mutation, Madness or Injury
permanently Healed.

playing songs, and they invite you to sit awhile with them and pass the time.

tribulations you’ve seen out on the road.
Stop all movement for the day as you settle in with the cowboys. Each
Hero may choose one activity to perform and rolls a Skill Test:
• Sing a song: Spirit
• Tell a Story: Lore

much so that it’s kicking up a storm of dust all around it.
Agility 6+
Any Hero that fails gains 10 XP and is thrown from their horse and
suffers
Wounds with no defense and rolls a D6. On a result of 1 or 2,
their Transport item is Killed or Destroyed by the speeding thing. Those
that succeed at their Agility test gain 20 XP, but otherwise suffer no ill
effects apart from a newfound healthy paranoia of high-speed objects.
17	Charming Figure
Encounter ◆ Stranger ◆ Charm
A masked figure is riding hell-bent for leather towards you. As they come to a
stop in front of you, they take off their bandanna to reveal an attractive face.
One of the Heroes catches their eye and they ride up next to them, their lusty
intentions made blatantly obvious with their flirtations.
The Hero with the highest Initiative is approached by this ravishing Rider
(choose one at random if tied for highest). For each Corruption Point on the
Hero, they must make a Willpower save. If more than half of their saves are
successful, or they have no Corruption, they resist the Rider’s charms and the
Rider simply leaves with a kiss. Otherwise, if not, the Rider leaves with a kiss...
and D3x$50 that they picked from your pocket while you were distracted!
18	One Last Drink
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
A bruised and bleeding man is reaching for a bottle of some greenish, glowing
liquid, but he can’t quite reach it and doesn’t have the strength to get to it. He
whispers some desperate, unintelligible words to you, asking for a drink.
A Random Hero may decide to assist the dying man to take a drink of
the greenish liquid before he dies. If the Hero decides not to help him
drink the liquid, the man collapses and dies with his last dying wish
unfulfilled. That Hero takes D3 Corruption Hits for denying a man his
last wish. If the Hero helps him, the man drinks and then mutates into
some bizarre gooey substance and slinks away, leaving $100, but each
Hero takes D6 Horror Hits at the sight of all this.
19	Opium Dreams

the total number of Madnesses that a Hero has, they may remove one of
those Madnesses. Otherwise if it is equal to or greater than the number of

(including Items with a Dark Stone Icon and Items with Dark Stone
Upgrades on them). On a roll of 1 or 2, that Item is snatched away from
them by a BogBat (discarded).
An old hag of a woman, white haired, wrinkled face, and a mean look in her

try to devour any living thing they come in contact with.
The brambles open upon a stone pathway of half-sunken stones. A most
welcome relief for the Posse from the constant sucking of the swamp. Whatever
stone structure the party walks upon is enormous. The mossy staircase takes them
above the canopy exposing a vista that covers many miles.
Any Heroes that do NOT have any Hat or Coat Gear take D6 Wounds,
ignoring Defense, as the rain of slimy Necrotoads falls all about them and
then dies. Movement out of this hex will cost 1 extra Move point as the
squishy things will make the going a bit rougher for a few miles until the
Posse can get clear of the darn things.
The Posse may immediately begin a Temple of Dread Mission [Jargono:6].
The difficulty of this Mission is one level higher than the Posse level,
but the reward for this Mission is

down, they gain 25 XP, take D6 Wounds (no Defense) and roll once on
the Injury Chart. If the Bastard is gunned down, the Hero gains D3x50
XP and draws a Loot card.

The people around here seem to regard you with suspicion, though there’s
something not quite right about the people of this town. You swear you saw
some forked tongues among the townsfolk, but you’re just not sure.
Any Heroes with Corruption gain a discount on any Services or Purchase
Items they buy while in Town. To determine the discount, multiply the
number of Corruption Points on a Hero by $10 (minimum price is $25
for any Services or Purchase Items). This discount is only available for
this Town visit as the sinister-looking townsfolk are driven out not too
long after this.
Alternatively, you may resolve this Encounter using the High Noon (Solo)
Mission [Frontier:6].
07	An Obvious Incentive
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
You catch sight of a shady man talking to a town official. You see an exchange
on money as both look around to see if anybody is watching. The town official
meets you eye-to-eye, then quickly collects his things and vacates the area.
03 W ell Wishers
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Mission
Someone is trying their darndest to give you a hard time while in this
Town. The next time you visit this Town, everyone in the Posse has a -1
modifier to their Camp Site Hazard, Town Event, and Location Event rolls.
The well in town seems to have become home to some nasty other worldly
creatures that are attackin’ any locals that try for water. Seems somebody
disturbed somethin’ below the town that was better left to sleep.
The Heroes may immediately begin a Seal the Void Gate Mission
[Basic:3] to save the Town (Mission occurs beneath the Town itself). If
the Heroes fail to complete that Mission on this Town hex within 10 days,
the Town will be Destroyed as no residents care to stick around a Town
without a water source.
08	Military Matters
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Law
A company of US Cavalry is here in town, passing through on their way out on
a mission. They’ve stopped here to restock on some supplies and question some
of the locals.
04	The Getaway
If there are any Heroes with the keyword ‘Outlaw’ in the group, each
‘Outlaw’ Hero must roll a D6. On a 6, that Hero is recognized by
someone from the Cavalry. Unless the Posse moves at least 2 hexes away
by the end of day, those Heroes that are affected must pay $100 or take
D8 Wounds in the ensuing escape from the Cavalry. If you are in a Town
Visit when this happens, immediately end your Town Visit.
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Outlaw
Walking down a street, gunfire erupts from a local establishment and a couple of
outlaws come streaming out of the place. They fire a few shots into the air and
run for some horses waiting nearby. It’s a holdup!
If you attempt to stop the Outlaws, each Hero makes a series of three
Attacks (Melee or Ranged). If at least half of each Heroes’ Attacks hit
(against Defense 1), then the Posse manages to recover the money from
the Outlaws and return it to the shopkeeper and each Hero gains 20 XP.
If the Heroes fail to stop the Outlaws, then the Location they held up is
devastated by the robbery and has to close shop. One Random Location in
this Town is Destroyed.
09	Pleasure Before Business
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
A group of scandalously under-dressed saloon girls go walking by, beckoning
you to partake in their “comforting presence”.
Each Hero that wants to may pay D6x$50 and then rolls a D6. On any
roll above a 1, that Hero may remove an Injury. If a Hero rolls a 1, they
roll on the Injury Chart as they are beaten and robbed instead.
05	Dark Skies
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Darkness
The sky begins to darken and up in the sky you see a total eclipse, however,
there’s an odd, evil purple glow that you’ve never seen in an eclipse before.
10	Tempting Situation
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
There is an evil presence in this Town. On your next Town visit here you
have a -1 to any Town Event Chart rolls.
A clearly drunk and obese businessman stumbles past the Posse. He tips his hat,
excuses himself and then begins to vomit uncontrollably into a horse trough. He
ends by passing out in a disgusting heap. An almost overflowing coin purse can
be seen hanging from his belt, the glint of its contents seems to beckon you.
The Posse may take the coin purse and gains D3x$100 (altogether, not
each Hero), but each Hero takes D3 Corruption Hits if they do take the
coin purse.

16	On the Run
Encounter ◆ Environment
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Oddly enough, everything seems quite peaceful and serene in town today. Despite
all the danger out in the area nowadays, everything feels right in the world for
this one brief moment in time.A desperate-looking man comes running and takes cover behind a nearby barrel.
With a pleading look, he motions for you to be quiet as a Lawman can be seen
rushing past your Posse.
Nothing eventful happens.The Posse’s reaction depends on the makeup of the group. If there are
more Heroes with the keyword ‘Outlaw’ than ‘Law’ then they keep the
man’s position a secret and get a nice bribe out of the deal, each Outlaw
Hero gains $50. If there are more with the keyword ‘Law’ than ‘Outlaw’,
then they give up the desperate man to the Lawman and each Law Hero
gains 20 XP. If there are an equal number of either Hero, then the Posse
may choose which reward they get (all Heroes get the same reward).
12	Greatest Show on Earth
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Merchant
A vaudeville troupe is putting on a show for the townsfolk, who are hootin’ and
hollering like never before. It’s a welcome distraction from the troubles on the road.

Saloon, in addition to whatever Services or Items are found at any actual
Location they are visiting.

seem to like what he sees. He challenges you to some fisticuffs!
A Random Hero gets into a fight with a rowdy Drunk. Two D6 are
rolled for the Drunk, while the Hero rolls their Combat die. Both fighters
dice are rolled in parallel until a 6 is rolled. The first fighter to roll a 6
knocks the other fighter out. Each 6 rolled cancels out one of the other
fighter’s 6 results if rolled at the same time. If the Hero is knocked out,
they lose D3x$100. If they knock out the Drunk, they recover 1 Grit and
gain 1 Whiskey Side Bag Token.
15	The Orphan
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Ally
In your search, you find that something is stalking you through the alleyways in
town. Just as you turn round the corner, you catch sight of your stalker. A small
Orphan boy has been following you. He asks for your protection because he’s on
the run from a group of Outlaws who want him dead for something he’s seen
or done.
If you refuse, each Hero takes
Corruption Hits for refusing to help
an Orphan. If you take him on, he becomes an Ally controlled by one
Hero during their Activation. He can use whatever Weapons the Posse
gives him that he is able to wield.
The Orphan has the following stats:
Keyword: Youth
May not Dual Wield Guns
Health 6 (4+ Defense)
Sanity 6 (4+ Willpower)
Combat 1
Range/Melee To Hit: 4+
If he dies while traveling with the Posse, each Hero permanently loses 1
Sanity. Only one Orphan may travel with the Posse at a time. The Posse may
dismiss the Orphan at any time, but each Hero takes D6 Corruption Points
with no Willpower Save unless each Hero gives up $100 to the Orphan.

A horde of orphan kids begin to swarm around your Posse. You shew them away
to get some space, but a quick check of your pockets reveals that they’ve already
gotten what they came for.

Heroes that pass this test gain 20 XP.

by one Hero per day until the end of the Heroes’ next Adventure.
20	Local Opportunity

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Undead
His eyes spit the flames of damnation. The Preacher’s long robes are sewn from
the burnt flesh of sinners who have fallen beneath his black book. Behind him
flock his congregation of black flames that beseech the Posse to join them.A ghoul before you doesn’t seem to know that he is dead. He also doesn’t seem
to know he doesn’t have a head. Regardless, he seems to be trying to hand you
a whiskey.
Each Hero takes 1 Wound for each point of Corruption they have, while
those without any Corruption gain 1 free Blessed Aura (player choice,
automatically applied) that lasts until the end of the next Adventure.Each Hero takes D6 Horror Hits. Any Heroes that don’t take any Sanity
damage from this gain a Whiskey Side Bag Token.
02	The Murder Ballad
07	Droning of Flies
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Horror
Encounter ◆ Stranger ◆ Ghost
The scenes about you are almost too much to handle, while you can never seem
to find any bodies, spatters of blood punctuate the burned remains of a once
thriving town. The stench of death and the constant buzzing of flies is perhaps
the worst of it, threatening to drive you mad and send you running as fast as
your legs will take you.
Amongst the wreckage and the carnage, a lone figure clothed in white
approaches the Posse, her feet never seeming to touch the ground. A woman
with pale features and sad vengeance in her eyes beckons you to approach her.
She tells you a sad tale of lust, murder, and conspiracy. The spirit tells you where
you can find the final resting place of her damnable husband’s dark secret, buried
deep in a mine. She implores you to return it here so that she may finally be free
of this mortal plane.
The next time the Posse finds a Clue Icon while down in the Mines, the
Heroes may uncover a Cursed Artifact item instead of applying that Clue
Icon towards the Mission. This Cursed Artifact has 1 Weight Icon and
has 1 Dark Stone Icon. The Hero who carries this Cursed Artifact is -1
to any Willpower rolls while carrying this item. If the Cursed Artifact is
brought back to these same Town Ruins the Heroes may give the item to
the spirit to destroy it. Upon successful completing this task, each of the
Heroes recovers 1 Grit and gains 30 XP.
Each Hero takes 3 Horror Hits. Any Hero that does not pass at least 2
out of those 3 Horror Hits must then roll on the Madness Chart (Sanity
damage is also applied as normal).
08	Restore the Crosses
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Holy
Outside of town the Posse contemplates what manner of beast dug up the
cemetery’s graves and removed the crosses.
If there are any Heroes in the Posse with the keyword ‘Holy’, they must
work to restore those graves that were desecrated. This will require 3 days
of work at this cemetery to fully restore all the desecrated graves, however,
for each 1 Grit that is spent by a Hero, that time can be reduced by 1 day
(minimum 1 day).
03	Orphan Killers
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Horror
The streets silently fill with the mangled corpses of children subjected to every
terror. Their faces carry a dim remembrance of innocence, but their eyes can not
conceal the horror of their ends.
If the Posse leaves early or does not restore any of the graves, any Heroes
with the keyword ‘Holy’ are -1 Faith token for their next Adventure per
day not spent restoring the cemetery (max -3 Faith). If the Posse fully
restores the cemetery, any Heroes with the keyword ‘Holy’ are +1 Faith
and any other Heroes gain a free Blessed Aura of their choice (both
benefits last until the end of their next Adventure).
The Heroes are so affected by this horrible sight that they are -1 to all
Willpower rolls until the end of their next Adventure.
04	Falling Ash
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Fire
09	Specters in the Night
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Void
A heavy soot drifts in lazy puffs, like fat snowflakes, this would almost be an
idyllic holiday scene, were it not for scenes of carnage and destruction all about
you. You arrive at the town square and discover a massive pit of magma,
belching out ash, slowly devouring the town from below.
A dark shape moves amongst the shadows, watching you from the empty shells
of buildings.
A Random Hero has been targeted by a Dream Hound! The thing will
stalk the Hero while they sleep and always linger at the edge of their
vision no matter where they go! While the Dream Hound stalks them,
the Hero will be at -2 Initiative and they are -1 to all of their Willpower
rolls until they are able to shake the influence of the Dream Hound.
The ground beneath the group is unstable and begins to give way as
magma swallows up the town! Each Hero must make 2 out of 3 Agility
and/or Luck 4+ tests or else their current Transport is Destroyed. Also,
move the Posse 1 hex away using the Random Hex Diagram. The hex
where the town once stood is now permanently uninhabitable and
untraversable for the remainder of the campaign.
The Dream Hound can only be banished by traveling to an Other World
and using up an Occult Scroll Side Bag Token and making a Spirit 5+
test as their sole action during their Activation to seal the infernal beast
on that plane of existence. This Sealing action does not count towards
Sealing a Mine and may only be attempted once per Adventure or day.
The Heroes may travel to an Other World and use an Occult Scroll
during the course of a regular Mission or when traveling via an Other
World Overland map.
05	The Good Samaritan
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
As you make your way down a wide alleyway, you hear a faint sound coming
from somewhere nearby... It sounds like a survivor!
Each Hero makes a Scavenge roll. If collectively the Heroes roll as many
6s as there are Heroes in the Posse, a Survivor is found! If the Survivor is
found, each Hero recovers 1 Grit.

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Creature
Behind the Town and down a little hill runs an oily stream of water. A gathering of
hunger and soul worn individuals have collected around a Preacher. Holding his Bible
high he thunders the sin of mans, and with a flick of his wrist ignites an inferno. There’s
no time to save any of the townsfolk, you’ll have a hard enough time saving yourself!
Each Hero rolls their Agility dice and adds together the results, then
subtracts from this the number of current weight icons the Hero is currently
carrying. The Hero with the lowest resulting number takes D8 Hits from
the Fire (if tied, all affected Heroes take these Hits).

The tallest structure in the area is a church bell tower. When this town was still
active, it rang to summon the townsfolk to service. Presently it has become a
refuge for survivors looking to escape the hoard of Hungry Dead that have

The saloon glows with such an intensity and strobed lights stream from the
building. Within the blinding light, six silhouetted figures move out of the saloon.
Six low brimmed cowboys stand absolutely motionless facing the Posse. Together
as one, they lift their heads and the guns in their hands.
Distribute 6 Hits amongst the Posse (minimum 1 Hit per Hero) within one
minute or every Hero in the Posse takes 6 Hits instead. Each Hit a Hero
fails to defend against does an amount of damage to a Hero equal to the
amount of Corruption Points that Hero has (minimum 1).

Town, they gain 30 XP each. No effect if that Town is Destroyed.
14	The Taken
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Mystery
Though you had heard about the terrible fate that met this Town, you expected
more savagery and desolation. Instead, you find the Town fully intact, it’s just
that there are no people anywhere. Everything remains untouched, almost as if
the people simply vanished without a trace.
Within a week, word reaches the rest of the region that the Town is safe
to return to and it fills back up with opportunists and freeloaders, however
the Town seems off for some reason, as if something dark has taken hold.
These Town Ruins are converted back into a regular Town (standard Town
Set Up), but add the Town Trait ‘Unstable Gate’ to this Town.
15	Talons of the Occultist
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Undead
Someone or something has animated the bodies of the dead townsfolk here.
There seems to be an Occultist come to town who is orchestrating these bodies
for some evil purpose.
Immediately begin a Seal the Void Gate Mission [Basic:3] in some
caverns beneath this Town. The final Fight will be an Epic Level Threat
comprised of an Occultist Villain, 4 Corpse Piles, &
Hungry Dead.
If the Heroes are successful, the Town is cleared of this menace and
eventually after a week life returns to the Town. Transform these Town
Ruins back into a regular Town (standard Town Set Up). If the Mission
is failed, then streams of the Hungry Dead march forth and manage to
Destroy a Random Building in EACH Town within 6 hexes.

As you search through the wreckage of this decimated settlement, you begin to
find survivors. Curiously though, only the children seemed to have been spared
death in this place, and of these, they all have milky white eyes, no pupil or iris is
visible. A following of these orphans begins to congregate around the Posse.
If the Posse chooses to escort these children back to another town, they slow
the party down with their odd, halting steps. No matter what terrain they
travel over, Posse movement is treated as going over Tough terrain until they
reach the next Town where they can get these children with caregivers.
If the Posse goes into a Mine, these children will be killed if that
adventure is failed in any way. If this happens or if the party decides to
abandon the children, every member of the Posse gains D8 Corruption
Points (do not roll for Willpower).
20	Local Spirit
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Ghost ◆ Explore
The spirit of a dead farmer appears before you and tells you his story before he
died. You sit and listen to his tale and learn about his life, his family, and his
home. As a reward for your time and letting him tell one last soul about who he
was, he tells you of something he has seen just outside of town.
Select an adjacent hex and flip over an Exploration Token. If you Search
that specific hex on this day, draw the face-up Exploration Token.
Otherwise draw from the next face-down Exploration Token for any other
hexes that you Search this day. Reshuffle all the Exploration Tokens at the
end of the day.
Terrain Encounters
A banquet that would make a king blush is laid out in the center of Town. The
food’s aroma causes the Posse to swallow hard, and smack lips. Something is
seriously wrong here, for the flies are thicker than a bucket of spit, but they won’t
come within ten feet of the feast.
Roll once on the Injury AND Madness Charts, you have
gained one from each!
Some of the crows follow after your party. The next time your Posse is
involved in a Fight on the Overland map, each Hero takes an additional
Wound each time they take any Wounds during that Fight. The crows
fly away after that and the effect is ended.
17	Last Refuge
Encounter ◆ Environment

This desolate town is filled with not only the carcases of its former inhabitants,
but also a horde of crows that are feasting upon those same corpses. As you walk
through the empty streets, the crows stop to watch you. They show no fear at
your passing and exude an air of malevolence at your passing. They have tasted
the flesh of man and found that it was good.GROWING DREAD ENCOUNTER

Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
A Dandy dressed to the nines, with a smokestack hat leaning in a devil-may-care-
attitude approaches the party. A glint of red is hinted in the eyes of the stranger,
as he puffs on a fat cigar. The rising smoke wreaths his tall hat in the uncanny
shape of a halo.
Though it’s the middle of the day, the sky begins to darken all around as if it
were suddenly the dead of night. A man dressed in an Undertaker’s garb with
round glasses and a top hat wanders into view. He smiles at your Posse, but the
sight of his yellow-stained teeth sends chills down your spine.
If the Posse carried with them any Heroes who were killed that they
wanted to resurrect, those Heroes are now permanently Dead and cannot
be resurrected.
Terrain Encounters
Cunning 5+
The Dandy is a whirling dervish of lies, deceit, and trickery. Each Hero
that fails the Cunning test loses D6X$50 to the Dandy (or as much money
as they have), who talks them into investing in a wild scheme that, upon
second thought, makes you realize you’re never going to see your money
ever again.
06 W alks Like an Angel
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Charm
The Posse hears the sobbing of a woman, issuing from an unnatural blur in the
shape of a large egg. The egg burns up in an inferno, revealing what at first
appears to be a nude woman with red-ashen skin and two great horns sprouting
from her head, but as you get closer you see that it is in fact the most beautiful
woman you’ve ever seen.
02	Echoing Laughter
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Madness
The unrestrained laughter of pure madness reverberates in great pounding waves
that echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes... The mind is drawn into the laughter
and laughs and laughs and laughs.
A Random Hero has been seduced and becomes the Woman’s Lover, she
will travel with the Posse until she is removed. Their nightly bouts of lust
sap that Heroes’ endurance and they are at -D6 to their Max Health
while the Woman travels with the Posse. The rest of the Posse is at
-1 Initiative while the Woman travels with the group from the lack of
sleep they get while the Lovers are engaged.
Each Hero rolls once on the Madness Chart.
03	Swarm of Eyes
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Hell
The only way the Woman can be removed from the group is if the
Posse fails a Mission, in which case the Woman can be seen joining
with the escaping Darkness. She will Destroy an additional Random
Town Location on top of any other damage that occurs from failing the
Mission (ignore this if the Town is outright Destroyed).
A wall of black flaps, like a cathedral’s tapestry. It stretches around the Posse -
a black veil without substance. A thousand eyes simultaneously snap open and

If failed, that Hero has gained the ‘Demon Host’ Curse! Any time that
Hero becomes KO’d in a Fight, a Demon appears on or as close to the

the KO’d Hero is revived during that Fight. The Demon will reappear
anytime the Hero is KO’d, even if the Demon is ever killed.

HellBat
The earth upon which the Posse strides flickers between what is and a world
made from crawling flies. The strobing effect quickens and slows to an unknown
rhythm. When the Lord of Flies is revealed, a great crawling mass can be seen
approaching the party. Each shimmer between here and there brings the crawling
horror closer and closer.
This Curse can be removed at a Church Town Location using the
Exorcism of Madness ritual. The Exorcism is performed as usual but
removes this Curse instead of removing any Madness.
04 B lind Sided
A Random Hero has become the Avatar of the Lord of Flies. While they
are the Avatar, they are –D6 to their Max Health. Whenever another
Hero becomes KO’d (may not target the last Hero to have the role of
Avatar unless in a two-person Posse), this Hero may, as an action in place
of their Attack, feast upon the KO’d Heroes’ soul. This does not kill the
Hero, but instead transfers the status of Avatar of the Lord of Flies to
that Hero. The original Hero gains back their lost Max Health and also
steals an additional D6 Max Health from the new Avatar (they lose an
equal amount to their Max Health). This bonus is lost when a new Hero
becomes the Avatar.
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Attack
While you are focused on your search, you fail to notice the horde of monsters

A black obelisk shifts in space. The weight of remembrance oscillates within its
anguish. A black needle appears on the horizon puncturing the gathering clouds.
It waivers and dances a slow slapping undulation that licks the earth bare.A stranger in a dark coat and a red right hand approaches. His charming gaze and
smooth way with words belie a frightening presence. He makes you an offer you’re not
sure if you should turn down or not...
A Black Obelisk has appeared over the nearest Mine. That Mine has
now become ‘Blighted’. When in that Mine, the Heroes take a number
of Horror Hits equal to the number of spaces down the Depth Track
the Darkness marker has moved from the Darkness Start each time the
Darkness marker ends up on or passes a blood splatter space.If John Moulton was previously encountered and a Hero made a Deal, that Hero
is Dead. Otherwise, a Random Hero may make a Deal with the Bastard, John
Moulton. They gain the ‘Devil’s Mark’ Curse. This Hero automatically gains 1
level and gains an Unholy power. If this result or John Moulton is ever rolled
again, John Moulton comes to collect on the bargain and this Hero is Dead.

10	Corridor of Infinity
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
Unholy Fear - Whenever an Enemy would target you, roll D6. On
a 1 or 2, that Enemy targets another available Hero, unless no other
Heroes are in range or are targetable (ignore how many Enemies
are targeting other Heroes when this happens). Whenever other
Heroes start their Activation adjacent to you, they take 1 Horror Hit.
2Vampirism - Whenever you kill an adjacent Enemy, you must either
Heal 1 Wound, Heal 1 Sanity, or Recover 1 Grit, but you always take
1 Corruption Hit when you Heal or Recover Grit in this way.
3Souls of the Damned - You recover 1 Grit whenever another
Hero becomes KO’d and that KO’d Hero makes one extra roll on
the Injury/Madness Chart when recovering (only when they would
normally roll on the Injury/Madness Chart).
4Cruel Fist - You roll D8s for Melee Combat and Melee Damage
if you have nothing equipped in either of your Hands. Critical on
rolls of 6, 7 or 8. For each Wound you do to an Enemy in this way,
every other Hero within Line of Sight to you takes 1 Horror Hit.
5Serenade of Pain - Once per Fight, you may use the Serenade
of Pain. Roll a D6 for every model on the same Map Tile as
you. On a 1, that model loses its next turn and all Hits against it
ignore Defense (‘Tough’ Enemies are immune) until the end of
the next turn.
6Evil Thrall - Once per Adventure, on a Melee attack that would
have killed an Enemy with less Max Health than your Hero, you
may claim that Enemy as a Thrall instead of killing it. That Enemy
model stays at their current health, but now activates during your
turn (ignore the Enemy’s Initiative). You may only have one Thrall at
a time and if that Thrall leaves your Heroes’ line of sight, you lose
control of it and it is gone. Take D3 Corruption Hits whenever
you use this ability.
First the sky and earth ceases to be. Then the blackness of nothing is devoured.
Then that which is you fades....
Spirit 5+
If failed, until the end of the next Adventure you must use a new Level
1 Hero in place of this Hero. At the end of the Adventure, that Hero
regains their memories and you go back to being the previous Hero. You
keep any XP, gold, or items the other Hero had accumulated.

The area about you shimmers with a crackling energy that makes your hair stand
on end! As you turn to run, your movements suddenly slow to a trickle, as if time
itself had stopped moving. This seems to last for an eternity, but gradually things
begin to pick up speed up again. As your eyes again focus on the world around
you, you find yourself on an alien world!
A Gate has opened around the Posse and transported you to a Random
Other World! Begin a Mission on the Other World Entrance Map Tile,
any Gates found automatically lead back to Earth and the Overland map.
No other special rules apply.
14	Psychic Rupturing
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Madness
You come across a tortuously deformed primitive idol. It appears to have been
carved from obsidian, yet there’s a faint unnatural purple glow to it. When you
are all within arm’s length of the despicable carving, it suddenly glows bright
and begins to speak words in a long-dead language. As you clutch at your eyes,
you can feel the alien words burning themselves into your psyche, a supernatural
sickness on your mind.
Spirit 5+
Each Hero that is successful gains 20 XP and nothing else happens. If
a Hero fails, they gain the ‘Phobia’ Madness. In a Fight, Heroes with
Phobia may not target Enemies that match their specific Phobia and may
not be adjacent to those Enemies if able to Move or Escape. This Phobia
may be removed like any other Madness.

GROWING DREAD ENCOUNTER
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Void
19 B elly of the Beast
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Mission
The air about you fills with arrow-headed wasps that open in two. The wasps are
bobbing beaks that pierce the veil between dimensions. Flickering tongues sway
in synchronicity, humming tones beyond the range of human hearing. Still, you
feel their song reverberate within your skull, as an evil feeling roils in your heart.A great leviathan flies above the Posse, like a giant monstrous whale. It seems to
swallow clouds whole and suddenly begins to plummet towards the Heroes! The
leviathan opens wide its maw and crashes into the land all around the Heroes,
swallowing both whole!
For each point of Corruption that a Hero has roll a D6. On a roll of 1
that Corruption point is removed, but the Hero gains a random Mutation
from the Mutation Chart. Heroes will not die from rolling multiple times on
the same Mutation when Mutations are gained in this way (ignore the roll,
though they will die in the future if they roll on these same Mutations again).If the Heroes were searching in the same hex as a Town when getting this
result, that Town is Destroyed! Regardless, the Heroes must immediately
begin an Escape Mission [Basic:5] while inside the belly of the beast (use
standard Mine map tiles, same Setup/Objective/Reward/Failure rules apply).
When the Heroes have completed the mission, whether successful or not,
they emerge D6 hexes away (use the Random Hex Diagram for which
direction to move, stop if the edge of the map is reached). If the Heroes
fail the mission, they also take D8 Wounds and the nearest Town loses
a Random Building, in addition to the conditions listed in the Escape
Mission description.
16	The Golden Child
Terrain Encounters
Encounter ◆ Active ◆ Stranger
A murmuring fly has gained the attention of the Posse. It flies as if it is writing
words of great importance. A swirling pool of blank ink rises into a great
thundering column, and flickers with black lightning. The pool lifts, and a young
boy with honey eyes and radiant skin extends his hands towards the Posse.
20	Local Disaster
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard
The Posse carries with them an Antichrist child, he will not leave the
Posse. This child will Destroy the next Town or Settlement the Heroes
enter into (the child is consumed in the destruction of that Town). If the
Heroes decide to kill the child instead, they each take
Corruption
Points (ignores Willpower).
You see a plume of dark, black smoke rising off in the distance. You know in
your heart that that can’t possibly be a good sign.
Roll a D6. If there is a Town within that many hexes from your current
position, D3 Random Buildings are Destroyed within that Town.
Choose one if there is more than one Town in that area.
17	Crystal Prison
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Hazard
As you travel along, a bolt of pale bluish energy suddenly erupts from the
heavens, right into the middle of the Posse! When you look up, you find that one
your group has become fully encased in a crystalline growth, they appear frozen
in place.
A Random Hero has become trapped in a crystal solid. While encased
they may not move or activate and must be carried by another Hero
everywhere. Each Overland movement costs 1 extra Move point and each
movement in the mines also costs 1 extra Move for that Hero. Trapped
Heroes are immune to any Wounds, Sanity Loss, Injuries, Madness or
loss of Items/Gear/Side Bag Tokens, but also do not gain anything (XP,
Loot, etc) from Fights or Encounters.
The only way to remove this condition from a Hero is to make a visit to
a Doc’s Office or Blacksmith. If removed at a Blacksmith, you also gain
D6x$100 from the Blacksmith as he is able to make use of the crystal for
other projects.
18	Fire and Brimstone
Encounter ◆ Environment ◆ Fire
Burning pellets of fiery hail scorch the skin and burn holes through clothing. You
look around for any kind of cover from the fire that rains down all around you.
Each Hero rolls a D6 for each Clothing item they have. On a roll of
1, that Clothing item is Destroyed unless it is resistant to Fire or grants
immunity to Fire.
60WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS
Wilderness Encounters were introduced in earlier versions of HexCrawl and they remain largely unchanged this time
around as well. Previously they occured after a number of Move points were spent, but this has been changed so that you roll
for these at the beginning of the day before the Posse begins moving. This is to streamline gameplay a bit more so you’re not
counting Move Points, then stopping to roll, dealing with Encounters, and then picking back up with your movement again.
Wilderness Encounters
At the beginning of each day, a single player in the Posse
rolls a D8 to determine if they have a Wilderness Encounter.
On a result of 1 (or if anyone in the Posse is on foot, on a
1 or 2), the Heroes have a Wilderness Encounter and roll on
the Wilderness Encounter Chart to see what they find. Players
may want to assign a single person to this duty or can pass it
around for longer journeys. If using Wilderness Encounters, any
mention in the regular rules of the Travel Hazard Chart also
refers to the Wilderness Encounters Chart. The group may use
the Wilderness Encounters Chart, the Travel Hazards Chart, and
the Expanded Travel Hazards Chart interchangeably as they
wish throughout their travels, but should probably stick to
one of those Charts for consistency. The Wilderness Encounters
Chart specifically references movement on the Overland map.
While Wilderness Encounters trigger on a roll of 1 in the
basic rules, keep in mind that in some HexCrawl campaign
styles, this number is affected by the position of the Darkness
marker on the Overland Darkness Tracker.
Also, if Wilderness Encounters don’t happen often enough,
feel free to adjust the dice type to a D6 or even raise the
trigger number. Keep in mind though that the more Wilderness
Encounters that you have, the more time you’ll spend on the
Overland map vs having Adventures in Mines or Towns.
Wilderness Encounter Results
Many Wilderness Encounters will guide you to reference
a Result Number, something like “Go to 26a” or “Go to 73a”
or whatever. This is usually done when the Heroes have a
decision to make and helps to keep the results of that decision
hidden from the players to add suspense and make the players
think about their decisions a bit more. To reference the Result
Number, flip to the next section ‘Wilderness Encounter
Results’ and find the Result Number specified from the
Wilderness Encounter.

97 The BronzeWILDERNESS ENCOUNTER RESULTS
Wilderness Encounter Results
Wilderness Encounter Results are meant to be read blindly after the Posse has decided on a course of action during a
Wilderness Encounter. This hopefully adds a bit of suspense to their choice and can even ensure that the same encounter plays
out differently depending on what the players choose.
#ChoiceDescription
00aMove past the
entranceGain 10 XP. As the group rides off away from the underground entrance, the ground beneath them begins to shake and the
Heroes are thrown to the ground. The Heroes fall through fissures in the ground to land in an underground cave, but they’re not
alone. Stop all Overland movement for the day. The Heroes must immediately go on an Escape Mission [Basic:5] to get back out.
01aGive the body Gain 50 XP. As you dig a grave for the poor gent, you start getting nauseous. The flowers seem to be emitting some foul, toxic
a proper burial fumes! Each Hero must pass a Strength 5+ test or take D6 Wounds as they run from the area.
02aHoly
The fanatical crowd is whipped up into a frenzy and brings out a captive with a bag over their head. It appears to be some poor
soul that developed a hideous mutation, they’re so far gone it’s hard to even call them ‘human’ anymore. The Preacher calls upon
those that are untainted to cast the first stone and hands you a hefty rock to throw. If you throw the stone, everyone else will follow
suit and the Mutant will be killed. Gain 25 XP, +1 Max Faith, and take D6 Corruption Hits as you have done what a fellow man
of God has required of you, but you still have your doubts if it was the right choice to make.
If you refuse to throw the stone, gain 50 XP. The Preacher turns to you and calls you out as consorting with Demons and
Fornicators. The rest of the crowd turns on you and in the ensuing chaos the mutant captive is able to escape. The crowd chases
the Posse off with rocks, each Hero in the group takes
D6 Hits. The nearest Church town location is now permanently closed off to your group as word
of your heresy has reached their ears and no godly folk will have anything to do with you.
03aKeep your
distanceDespite their pleas for assistance, the Posse turns its back on these obviously sick & diseased Indians. Better to let them die in peace
rather than spread the plague you tell yourselves as the blood-choked curses of the Indians fade off in the distance. If you do not
have the keyword ‘Tribal’, you gain the keyword ‘Paleface’ and lose the ‘Kemosabe’ keyword if you already had that.
04aCross over the
bridgeGain 25 XP. As you start to cross over the bridge, giant tentacles reach out from underneath the bridge to ensnare a random Hero.
That Hero must roll to defend against D3 Hits. Each Hit that gets past their Defense deals 3 Wounds.
05aKemosabe/
TribalGain 25 XP. You hail the Indian brave and ask his intentions of the woman. He explains that the woman’s husband is a dark priest
in an evil cult and has cast a horrible curse on the woman. He is bringing the woman to a nearby Shaman to have the curse lifted,
but warns that the woman will die within a week if she is not cured soon. He asks that the Heroes gather
Herbs and return to
this same hex to give him the herbs to save the woman’s life. If the Heroes return in time, they must give up the necessary amount
of Herbs, but will each recover 1 Grit and an additional 50 XP. If not, then they can assume the worst about the woman’s fate.
06aKeep movingGain 10 XP. The horses seemed to be spooked by something in the area and it’s best not to dilly-dally around the graves of the
dead. There might be something worth finding around here, but hell if you’re going to stick around and find out.
07aKeep ridingGain 10 XP. You have no time to be foolin’ around with no stupid kid stories. Everybody knows ghosts ain’t real. Now hurry up...
it’s gettin’ dark out.
08aLeave the
corpse be and
continue onGain 50 XP. You ride off, knowing that nothing good can possibly come from searchin’ around in the belongings of dead
folks, especially strangely dressed dead folks. Besides, it’s just not right to be lootin’ the dead.
09aRide around
the villageGain 10 XP. As you ride off, you could swear that you heard the crying of a child coming from the village, but you’ll never know
what it was you left behind in that abandoned village...
10aHolyAll Heroes with the keyword ‘Holy’ gain 25 XP. You can’t help but give everything you can to help these poor souls. Any Heroes
with the ‘Holy’ keyword must give half (rounded up) of their Gold to help these pilgrims on their journey. In addition they must
also give away 1 Side Bag Token and 1 Gear if able. In return for giving up all that, they recover 1 Grit and gain +1 Max Faith.
Otherwise, you give what you can, but only recover 1 Grit if unable to give everything listed.
11aInvestigate the
carved head
further
Luck 4+
Gain 50 XP and stop all movement for the day. As you walk about the giant head, you see that it is incredibly old, but find some
sort of switch mechanism on its’ backside. You cautiously activate the switch and the head opens up like a puzzle box. To your
horror a swarm of large centipede creatures scurries forth from the innards of the great head. The horses become panicked and ride
off in a flurry. Each Hero that fails the initial Luck test lose a random Token from their Side Bag. The creatures dig holes in the

Hero draws 1 Loot card.

12aAttack the
zombie!Gain 20 XP. You unleash a hail of bullets on the foul abomination, dropping it to the ground. It twitches for a time, but then stays
dead for good this time. That’s one less undead menace in the world. You can’t help but wonder though, where was it going to?
13aRefuse the
offerThe Heroes leave the merchant to his trouble and they continue on their way. Word gets around the business community. Prices
for all items & services are doubled at every Town the Heroes travel to until they complete their next Adventure (success or fail).
Funny how fast rumors can spread.
14aInvestigate the
wellGain 50 XP and stop all movement for the day. That hint of something shiny at the bottom of the well peaks your interest. A
random Hero shimmies down the well with a rope strapped around their waste to get a better look at what’s in there. As the Hero
gets closer and closer to the edge of the water they begin to make out what lies beneath the water. In a moment of horrible clarity,
the Hero sees the glint of a fancy necklace attached to a long dead corpse rising up from the depths of the well! More bodies begin
to stir and start clawing at the Hero, trying to pull them down into the depths. That Hero takes D3 Horror Hits, with each doing
3 Sanity damage to the Hero instead. The Hero is able to clutch onto something on their way up and pulls up the fancy necklace.
It is worth D3x$100 if sold at a Town.
15aInvestigate the
area
Cunning 6+
Gain 25 XP and stop all movement for the day. If everyone fails the test, nothing is found. If successful, you notice that the earth
around the graves doesn’t seem to be disturbed in any way, as if there was never anything buried there. In fact they seem to form
an arrow pointing at the outcropping of rocks. Further investigation of the area reveals an ‘X’ carved into one of the rocks and a
circle of stones beneath that ‘X’. You spend some time digging and discover a buried chest. Inside the chest is D6x$100.
Continue on
your wayGain 10 XP. It’s best not to disturb old burial mounds, ‘specially ones with strange tablets and terrible warnins’ all over them. What
kinda darned fools you think we is?
17aToss the book
awayGain 25 XP. Ain’t nothin’ good to be learned from dusty old books layin’ about. If it was worth learnin’ about they woulda put it
in the good Book for Godly folk to read about.
18aKeep on riding Gain 10 XP. It doesn’t look like there’s anything to be gained by that old shack, you ride on without so much as giving it a second
19aNeutralThe sentry stops the group and advises that a small donation of D6x$50 from the group is required to purchase from the
Indian Trading Post. If the group refuses, they leave and nothing else happens. If the group pays the donation, the group
may buy items as if they were at a Frontier Outpost (do not roll for a Location Event). Any Hero may make a Cunning 5+ roll
to attempt to get an item for $50 cheaper instead, but if they fail, that Hero gains the keyword ‘Paleface’ and is immediately
booted from the Trading Post.
20aKemosabe/
TribalGain 25 XP. As the Shaman dances about the group, he suddenly turns towards the group and freezes in his tracks. He blows a
fine white powder from his hand towards the group and begins to speak in tongues. Gradually his words start to gain clarity and
you can hear him calling out to you, “I have seen your pain and the heavy burdens that you bear. Let me ease the pain, so that you
may continue in your journey upon the plains and bring peace to the land once more.” Each Hero may choose a service: Cure 1
Injury, Cure 1 Madness, Remove D6 Corruption, Heal any combination of D6 Wounds/Sanity, or recover 1 Grit.
21aEscaping the
ravineBegin an Escape Mission [Basic:5], except split the party in half and place one group at the Mine Entrance tile and the other group
at the Cross Path tile as normal. Do not roll for Hold Back the Darkness tests and ignore the Dangerous Escape and Immediate
Dread special rules. Only when the Cross Path group uncovers map tiles or when Clue icons are uncovered does the Hero Posse
marker move up the Depth track. Whenever the Cross Path group uncovers a map tile, roll 2D6 and if the result is equal to or
greater than the current position of the Hero Posse marker, then the two separate maps are now joined together.

abomination in the name of all that is Holy. If you choose to stand and fight, each Hero makes a series of 5 Attack rolls (Melee or
Range). If 50% or more of the groups’ rolls hit, then you have scared off the rest of the congregation and recover 1 Grit and gain 75
XP. If less than 50% of the groups’ rolls hit, then the religious fanatics have gotten an advantage over you and have beaten you into a
chaotic retreat. Lose D6x$50 and 1 Gear or Artifact with a value of at least $200 in the ensuing craziness.
If the group decides to run away, gain 10 XP and stop all movement for the day as the group has to double back and loses time.
23aStart moving
in the other
directionGain 10 XP. That’s all the sight-seeing you have for the day. You don’t have to be told twice not to travel towards big explosions
like that, let them other fools get themselves killed trying to fill their hands with ash and cinder.
24aKeep your
distance from
the rats and
continue onGain 25 XP. The rats continue to follow behind the Posse. Until the end of your next Adventure, everyone in the group is -1 to
Initiative and the Posse will have Wilderness Encounters on a roll of 1, 2, or 3, whether or not the Posse is on horseback. After
the group enters its next Town following their next Adventure, the rats seem to disperse, though strangely enough the Town will
suffer from a rash of bizarre cat killings after that. That Town permanently gains the ‘Unstable Gate’ Trait if it didn’t already have it.
25aLawfulYou call out to them Scafford Gang boys to put ‘em up, but they don’t seem too determined to go down without a fight and start
shootin’ away. Before you manage to put the last of ‘em down, they get off some shots on the Posse. Each Hero takes D6 Hits.
You return the stagecoach passengers belongings to them and regain 1 Grit. On them Scafford boys you rummage around in their
pockets and manage to turn up D6x$50 in valuables, no doubt gained from criminal activities.

Exploration Mission [Basic:2] here, with double the reward as normal.
27aAttempt to

2-3 Lose D6x$50 of their Gold
4-6 Lose D6 Side Bag Tokens
28aLoot the
saddlebagThe saddlebag is filled with potions and concoctions in various colors. Each Hero may take a potion, but the effects for each potion
will be different and the effects will not be known until the potion is drunk by the Hero. Each Hero that gets a potion takes D6
Corruption Hits as well for looting the dead. Reference this Wilderness encounter number:
Roll a D8:
1
Attribute Inhibitor - You are at -1 to your highest Attribute. Roll a D8 each day,
the effect is removed whenever an 8 is rolled.

8
Cured! - Remove one Injury, Madness, or Mutation from your Hero.
29aCut the dead
man downGain 25 XP. You cut the rope that the corpse hangs from, only to discover that the man is actually quite alive! Without so much as a
word, the man rushes to the base of the tree, collects his clothes and runs off back down the road you came. You can only guess what the
fellah might’ve been doing up there in the first place.
30aPalefaceGain 25 XP. The injun doesn’t seem to have much left in him and his ending is pretty well set in stone at this point. You take aim
and fire, putting the native out of his misery. It sucks the fun out of the Rancher’s game, but they treat the killing as if you’d put
down a wild animal, nothing more. After some minor insults are hurled at you, they scatter and leave the Indian corpse out in the
sun. You put your gun back in the holster and ride on. Take D3 Corruption Hits for killing an unarmed man.
31aRide around
the stonesGain 10 XP. Meh. Let me know when somethin’ excitin’ happens, this group is boring as all hell.
32aPalefaceGain 25 XP and each Hero that has the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ loses that keyword and each Hero that doesn’t have the keyword
‘Tribal’, gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.
You’re able to ambush the Indian raiding party while they’re distracted with the settlers. Each Hero makes 5 Attack rolls (Range or
Melee). If the party as a whole successfully hits with 50% or more with their attacks, then most of the settlers are able to survive
the attack and the Indians are driven off. They thank you for your help in dealing with those savages and as a token of their esteem
offer what supplies they can spare: each Hero gains a Side Bag Token of their choice and an additional 50 XP.
If less than 50% of the groups’ hits connect on the Indian raiders, the settlers are not only decimated, but the Indians are also able
to get the advantage on the group and runs the Posse off before disappearing back into the wilderness. Each Hero takes D6 Hits
and loses 1 Gear or Artifact worth at least $150 in their mad dash to escape the Indian raiders.

Gain 25 XP, then Choose:
Guard the Shaman
No matter if the Shaman is crazy or not, he’s vulnerable in his current state to thieves or even wild animals. You have to keep watch
over the Shaman until he comes down from his trance. As if your fears were prophetic, a pack of Void Hounds appears over the
horizon, a look of terrible hunger across their eyes. The Void Hounds make an attempt at the old Shaman and everyone else in the
area, but you’re able to fend off the Void Hounds and eventually send them running. Each Hero takes D8 Wounds from the Void
Hounds. In time the Shaman wakes from his trance and thanks you for dealing with the evil spirits. He begins to sing a song of your
heroism and bravery. Each Hero in the group gains the keyword, ‘Kemosabe’.
Snag some of the Shaman’s supplies
As the Shaman prances about, he starts slithering around like a snake or lizard and goes over a nearby hill, out of sight of his
medicines and herbs. Seeing your chance, you start rifling through his bag and pick up some choice items. Surely in his state, this
Shaman wouldn’t know if he had consumed his own herbs or if he ever had them to begin with. Each Hero in the group that wants
to may make a Cunning 5+ roll to gain D6 Herbs, but any Hero that rolls a 1 or 2 is discovered by the Shaman and he curses all
Heroes that gained Herbs from his bag, regardless of what they rolled. Those Heroes gain the keyword ‘Paleface’.
Leave the Shaman be
This Shaman is obviously out of his mind and it’s best to leave him to his insane dancing. No good can come from messing
around with this drugged up fiend, he’d be better off in a sanitarium than this wilderness, but it’s not your job to care.
74#ChoiceDescription
34aNeutralWithout discussion or reading below, each Hero secretly chooses an action with a D6:
(Even # = Start shooting; Odd # = Put your weapon away):
Even side - Start shooting. If 50% or more of the Posse chooses this option then you make short work of the Indian Braves. Each
Hero that chose this gains 50 XP and draws 1 Loot card from what they’re able to recover off the Indians’ bodies.
If less than 50% of the Posse, but at least one Hero chose this option, then there is a brief battle. The Indian Braves manage to beat you back
and escape. As a result, every other Hero that chose the Odd side takes D6 Hits. Anyone that chose Even gains an additional 25 XP but
everyone in the group gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.
Odd side - Put your weapon away. You cautiously holster your weapon as a sign of goodwill. If everyone in the group chose this option
then the situation is defused and you’re able to talk things over and discover that the Indian Braves are searching for a kidnapped child in
the nearest Mine. You may begin a Search Party Mission [Basic:4] in the nearest Active Mine to recover the child, but have a time limit
of 3 days to finish the Mission. If successful, each Hero receives 1 Side Bag Token (choose between bandages, whiskey, or dynamite),
+1 Max Grit., and gains the keyword ‘Kemosabe’. However, the cost of failing the mission is double, D6 Corruption Hits, ignoring
Willpower. If you choose to ignore the mission then nothing happens.
35a
Paleface
The sentry recognizes an enemy of his people and moves to intercept the group. If you choose to fight the sentry, the group takes D8
Hits (spread out in whatever fashion amongst the group) and the other assembled Indians scatter far and wide. Anyone in the group
that doesn’t have the keyword ‘Tribal’, gains the keyword ‘Paleface’, if they didn’t already have it. Anyone with the keyword ‘Kemosabe’
loses that keyword.
If the group tries to make amends with the Indians, they must pay D6X$100 or give up 2 Gear or 1 Artifact PER Hero with the
keyword ‘Paleface’ in the group. If the price is paid, those with the keyword ‘Paleface’ lose that keyword. The Posse may now buy
items from here as if this were a Frontier Outpost (no Location event).
Move alongGain 10 XP. Likely just some damn swamp gas caught afire. Ain’t no cowboys gonna go rustlin’ around in that muddy
environment. Let them other folks go find their death in them Jargawno swamps, not these fellahs. We’s smartfolk.
37aAttack the ratsGain 50 XP. The Heroes attempt to kill the rats, but this only causes them to flee, frightening them off for the moment. During the
next few nights, the sounds of scurrying rats seem to be coming from all around you. Everyone is on edge.
Spirit 4+
Each Hero that fails the roll needs to make an additional roll on the Madness Chart. This temporary madness will last until the end
of the Heroes’ next Adventure. You’re never able to shake the feeling that the rats are still following you though...

(or sell value of an item), you gain 1 XP (example: $50 would give your Hero 10 XP).

These people seem to be a little off in the head, you tip your hat and wish them luck in their journey and promptly keep on riding.

40aEnter the
burial moundEnd all movement for the day and begin an Exploration Mission [Basic:2], with the exception that failure results in the current Hex
the players inhabit to become uninhabitable and untraversable. Mark the current Hex, that Hex may no longer be traveled through
again, it has been turned into a nightmarish wasteland by what the Heroes have unleashed.
41aLeave the
body beGain 10 XP. The group walks off, leaving the poor fellow to his flowery grave. Each Hero takes 1 Corruption Hit, knowing that
they done wrong by that poor fellah, leaving his body there to rot. Though at least he’s surrounded by them perty flowers.
42aMosey on
alongGain 10 XP. If the place is burned out and abandoned, then surely that means there’s nothing of value here anymore. Who in the
hell would’ve left anything behind? Besides, there’s dark stone, riches, and adventure to be had out there in the world, you ain’t got
no time for exploring every scorched piece of property in the area.
43aInvestigate the
village
Strength 5+
Gain 50 XP. The village seems to have contracted a plague and the Heroes may have become infected! Each Hero that fails their
Strength roll loses D6 to their Max Health and gains the ‘Infected’ keyword. The keyword (and the temporary health loss) can be
removed at a Doc’s Office. Use the Treat Corruption action, but no Corruption is removed and instead the ‘Infected’ keyword is
removed and the Hero regains the lost Max Health. Any Hero that rolls a 6 draws 1 Loot card, once per Hero.

Gain 10 XP. You pass by the carcass, wondering what happened to the poor soul that rode that animal. It looked to be a mighty fine
horse in its day, now it’s just sitting here, getting filled up on maggots. It makes you stop and wonder about your own place in the
universe, about no matter how hard you try or what noble deeds you perform, you’ll likely end up just the same: a rotting corpse
getting passed over by strangers.
In the distance a coyote howls. Some crickets nearby chirp. A snake and a frog are locked in deadly combat. Tumbleweeds blow on
by. Life goes on.

zombie for the better part of a day as it seems to walk towards an open patch in the middle of nowhere. The zombie eventually
comes to a stone and begins to dig into the ground. The zombie digs up what appears to be another corpse, curls up and lies
down beside the newly-revealed corpse. It stops moving after that. Alongside the pair of corpses, the group finds some personal
effects. Each Hero in the Posse may gain 1 Gear card, but takes D3 Corruption Hits for looting the dead.
50aPalefaceGain 25 XP. The Indian savage has obviously kidnapped this poor woman and is bringing her back to his barbaric tribe for a
life of slavery. If you don’t act quickly the honor of that woman will be despoiled! Each Hero in the group that is able to makes
a Range attack against the fleeing Indian. If the Posse is able to land at least 6 Wounds on the Indian brave, he is killed and the
woman is saved, otherwise he gets away. The woman does not speak and seems catatonic, but the group receives 50 XP and
D6x$50 as a reward from her grateful husband if the group returns the woman to the nearest Town within a week (7 days).
Otherwise, the woman will mysteriously die despite your best efforts to care for her.
If any 1’s are rolled during the attack, the woman is caught in the crossfire and killed and the Heroes take D6 Corruption Hits
from the guilt.
51aNeutralGain 25 XP. You keep your distance as you watch the events unfold with the congregation. You see a Mutant is brought out before
the gathered crowd, cursed and spat upon. A Random Hero has enough time to make a single ranged shot to save the mutant’s
life, otherwise the mutant is killed in front of the congregation. Each Hero takes D6 Horror Hits at the inhumanity. If the ranged
attack is successful, the mutant escapes! That Hero gains an additional 25 XP and recovers 1 Grit.
52aInvestigateYou call out to the man and without so much as turning to meet your gaze he hightails it out of there! That’s a damn horse thief if
you ever saw one and you take off in pursuit, ain’t nothin’ worse than a horse thief. Each Hero makes Agility 5+, Strength 5+, and
Luck 5+ rolls. As long as each test is passed by one or more Heroes, the challenge is a success and you manage to bring down the
horse thief. For every 1 rolled during those tests, one of the four stolen horses is accidentally injured and will have to be put down.
Each horse that is saved is worth $100 and 25 XP if returned to the nearest Town. The horse thief is worth $150 and 50 XP if
captured. If the challenge is failed, then the horse thief and the horses elude your grasp and he manages to get away, each Hero still
gains 10 XP.

you’re about to ride away, you notice the glint of something in the Indian’s belongings that the Ranchers seemed to have missed. A

Chase off the Ranchers
You ride in and get into a brawl with the Ranchers, chasing them away and keeping the Indian Brave from further harm. Despite

If you instead decide you want to keep the gold, you must roll a Spirit 6+ test. If failed, you take D6 Corruption Hits (but still

After it charges past the group, it suddenly takes flight on it’s fiery hoofs and flies off into the distance.
59aPalefaceGain 25 XP and stop all movement for the day. As you ride by the hooting and hollering Indian Shaman, he suddenly turns
towards you and freezes in his tracks. He hisses and growls at you like a wild caged animal and scratches the ground with his bone
stave. After a few moments of this he throws a glittering powder into the air and begins to scooch sideways around the group,
never breaking his gaze from you. At first he seems to be speaking in tongues, but at some point the words gain clarity and you
hear him cursing you as “cowardly, paleface dogs of the Black Goat, death walkers, false talkers, etc...”. As he does this, the world
begins to turn around you and you have horrible visions of people & things long dead and those soon to die by your hand. Each

to be hallways, spectral children at play in what must’ve been an orphanage at some point in the past. As you come to a central
courtyard area you find a ghostly woman weeping, she clutches a letter in her off-hand. Beside her lies a music box, an empty
canister of oil, and a box of matches. As the music box nears the end of its tune, the apparitions fade to nothing. Each Hero takes

he still thinks you’re trying to hurt him and he escapes. Each non-Tribal Hero gains the keyword ‘Paleface’ if they didn’t already
have it and loses the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ if they have that. If you fail the skill check or decide to let the child fall, he plummets to
his death. It was a terrible end for the child, but at least now no one will think ill of you. Each Hero gains D6 Corruption points.

able to make off with not only the Scafford Gang’s wallets, but the wallets and purses of the stagecoach passengers. The Posse gains
D6x$100 in gold and each Hero rolls a D6. On a roll of 5 or 6, that Hero has gained 1 Gear. However, each Hero that doesn’t
have the keyword ‘Outlaw’ also takes D3 Corruption Hits from, of course, not doing the right thing.

Stop the Indian
Gain 25 XP. The Indian savage has bad intentions for this woman and must be stopped from harming this woman further! Any
Hero or combination of Heroes must make 3 Range attacks. If at least 2 of the attacks hit, the Indian is killed, but if any 1’s are
rolled, the woman is also killed. Regardless, if the Indian is stopped then each Hero gains an additional 25 XP and 1 Gear. If the
woman is brought to the nearest Town within a week (7 days) the Heroes also receive D6x$50 from her grateful husband.
If the Indian is not killed, then he escapes and each Hero in the Posse gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.
Offer to help the woman
Gain 25 XP. The woman obviously needs help and if the Heroes collectively give up D6 Herb Tokens (or D6x$100 if Herbs are
unavailable), the Indian thanks you for your assistance and tells the group he is bringing the woman to a local Shaman to be cared
for. Each Hero gains an additional 25 XP and gains the keyword ‘Kemosabe’.
Leave them be
Gain 10 XP. Obviously this is something completely out of your league and it’s best if you didn’t get involved in whatever the hell it
is that’s happening here. You turn your head and forget that you ever saw whatever it was that you thought you saw.
72a
Investigate the
stones
Gain 25 XP and stop all movement for the day. The Heroes pass between the two stones, and they are immediately transported to
a random Other World! The Heroes begin on the Other World entrance tile. They must find 1 Clue icon and return to the Other
World entrance tile in order to get back to Earth. Exploration Tokens with Gates count as Doors instead. Failure will result in the
players immediately going on to an Escape Mission [Basic:5] at a Random Mine.

73aRide over the
mossGain 50 XP. As the group rides over the spongy moss you don’t notice anything at first and you seem to clear the moss without
incident. However, as you travel along, you see red streaks all over your horses’ legs. At first you think it’s just some staining from the
moss, but then all of sudden your horses legs begin to snap like twigs. Any horses you had with you go down hard and bleed to death
as their legs have become brittle and break from the ride. All of your horses have died. Any Heroes that were on foot lose any Foot
Gear that they may have had.

76aNeutralChoose:
Help the Settlers
Gain 25 XP and each Hero gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.
You’re able to ambush the Indian raiding party while they’re distracted with the settlers. Each Hero make 5 Attacks (Range or
Melee). If the party as a whole successfully hits with 50% or more with their attacks, then most of the settlers are able to survive
the attack and the Indians are driven off. They thank you for your help in dealing with those savages and as a token of their esteem
offer what supplies they can spare: each Hero gains a Side Bag Token of their choice and an additional 50 XP.
If less than 50% of the groups’ hits connect on the Indian raiders, the settlers are not only decimated, but the Indians are also able
to get the advantage on the group and runs the Posse off before disappearing back into the wilderness. Each Hero takes D6 Hits
and loses 1 Gear or Artifact worth at least $150 in their mad dash to escape the Indian raiders.
77a
Paleface
Gain 25 XP. These Injuns are up to no-good and can’t be trusted to get any closer. You draw your weapons and point them at the
Braves. You tell them to keep their distance, but they either don’t understand English or the weapons you drew have them on edge
because they immediately start aiming their own weapons at you.
Without discussion or reading ahead, each Hero secretly chooses an action with a D6
(Odd = Start shooting, Even = Put your weapons away):
Odd - Start shooting. If 50% or more of the Posse chooses this option then you make short work of the Indian Braves. Each Hero
that chose this gains 50 XP and draws 1 Loot card from what they’re able to recover off the Indians’ bodies.
If less than 50% of the Posse, but at least one Hero chose this option, then there is a brief battle. The Indian Braves manage to beat
you back and escape. As a result, every other Hero that chose Odd takes D6 Hits. Anyone that chose Even gains an additional
25 XP but anyone in the group with the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ loses that keyword and everyone in the group that doesn’t have the
keyword ‘Tribal’ gains the keyword ‘Paleface’.
Even - Put your weapons away. You cautiously holster your weapon as a token of goodwill. If everyone in the group chose this
option then the situation is defused and you’re able to talk things over with the Indians before they head off. Each Hero that has the
keyword ‘Paleface’ loses that keyword and everyone in the group gains 25 XP.
78aKeep on
movingGain 10 XP. Fearing that any interaction you might have with this foul shrine will have some
harmful effect, you decide it best to move on and let braver souls than you take their chances
with that accursed thing.
79aAttempt to
helpEach Hero that can, gives an Herb Side Bag Token and rolls D6. On a roll of 1, that player becomes infected and gains the
‘Diseased’ keyword until able to get healed at a Doc’s Office (use Heal Corruption action, but no Corruption is removed) or use
an Herb Token on themselves (ignore it’s normal effect, but remove the ‘Diseased’ keyword). While afflicted with the ‘Diseased’
keyword, players are at -D6 to Max Health and Max Sanity. Regardless, the Indians thank you for your help in curing them of their
sickness. Each Hero that gave the Indians an Herb Token gain 50 XP and non-Tribal Heroes lose the keyword ‘Paleface’ if they
have it and gain the keyword ‘Kemosabe’.
80aOutlawAs the Bandidos surround your group, the leader among them recognizes one of the Outlaws in your Posse and calls off the attack
at the last minute. Instead they share some whiskey with the group and reminisce about adventures and scams from days long
gone. Each Hero gains 25 XP and gets 1 Whiskey Side Bag Token.
81aGo investigate
the craterGain 25 XP. All around the area of the explosion is utter devastation, something with alot of force came crashing down into the
earth. At the epicenter of all that destruction the Posse finds a pitch black sphere of a rough, glowing rock billowing steam. After
some time the glowing begins to fade and the rock cools down enough that you can touch it. As you touch the rock, it cracks in
two, revealing a glittering diamond at its center! The diamond glows bright as the sun, temporarily blinding the group and then is
gone from existence. The party has gained 1 extra Revive token on their next Adventure.

have left, you look and find some supplies that the Indians seemed to have missed that were left by the fleeing settlers. Each Hero
draws 1 Loot card and takes D6 Corruption Hits at the realization that they stood by and did nothing as innocents were harmed.#

82aContinue on

You can’t be stopping every random stranger you happen to come across in your travels. There’s probably a perfectly rational explanation for why this
man would have other peoples’ horses, you tell yourself as the man makes a hurried exit around the bend. In a world filled with supernatural horrors
intent on our destruction, how can you fault a man for doing what he has to do to survive? Perhaps law & order will slide a little around Brimstone,
you’re too focused on absolute evil to worry about day-to-day petty crime.

If passed, roll a D6 to see what is found:
1-4 Gear - You find something useful. Draw a Gear card, these folks won’t have much use for these things now.
5

The sentry nods as the Heroes pass by into the Trading Post. The group may buy items as if they were at a Frontier Outpost (do
not roll for Location event). Prices are $50 cheaper than normal for anyone with the keywords ‘Kemosabe’ or ‘Tribal’. A non-Tribal
Hero may make a Cunning 5+ roll to attempt to get an item for $100 cheaper instead, but if they fail they either lose the keyword
‘Kemosabe’ if they have it or they gain the keyword ‘Paleface’ if they do have ‘Kemosabe’ as a keyword.

die if you pick the same Mutation twice on the Mutation Chart. You lose this benefit if the Madness is ever cured. You begin to see the
sign everywhere about you, in all things. The Yellow Sign permeates the universe and beckons to all. The King approaches, the stage is
set, the curtain rises, the play is commencing and you are but an actor on the stage. The Sign... The Sign is Yellow and it shall guide us
to He Who Shall Not Be Named and his herald on this Earth, The King in Yellow.
Luck 5+
Gain 25 XP. The group cautiously prods around the abandoned shack and find the insides in a state of disarray. Whoever lived
here has been gone a long while, but they may have left something behind. Each Hero that fails the Luck test finds D6x$10,
however if a Hero rolls any 1’s on the Luck test they find nothing instead. Each Hero that is successful draws 1 Gear card.
88aCross over

you can never be too careful.
89aThe Puzzle
BoxRoll once on the following table :
1
Attack - Draw a High level Threat.
2-3 A portal to another dimension opens up and the Heroes are pulled into a Random Other World! To escape, begin a
Mission on the Other World Entrance Map Tile (no special rules), the Posse must locate two Clue icons.
4-6 When solved the puzzle box plays a quick tune as if it were a self-playing piano.
90aEnter the
underground
cavernGain 25 XP. The Heroes enter the underground cavern and find something else has already made its home here... The group must
fight a Medium level threat! Use a Mine Entrance Map Tile and another single room tile with no exits for the encounter. Success
results in 1 extra Loot card per Hero (in addition to the normal Loot gained from the threat card). Failure results in each Hero
losing 1 Grit.

Assist the Indians
Seeing that these settlers have entered into known Indian territory, you have no choice but to come to the Indian’s aid. Your
combined forces make short work of the lightly defended settlers and you have your pick of the settler’s belongings, each Hero
draws 3 Loot cards. However, word of your treachery reaches the nearest Town (or Towns if multiple exist at the same distance)
and they will not accept you in their midst anymore. Each Hero gains the ‘Traitor’ keyword and each time your Posse is in that
Town’s hex or any of their surrounding hexes, you take D6 Hits from townsfolk attempting to chase you off. You may not enter
that Town or any of its Locations again (though the Town is not Destroyed yet).
Stop the attack
These settlers accidentally entered into Indian territory and meant no harm, you have to help these people out! You put yourself
between the Indian defenders and the settlers to stop the bloodshed. Unfortunately, you take some friendly fire and each Hero suffers
D6 Wounds. Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test to persuade the Indians that this was a misunderstanding. If 50% or more of
the Heroes are successful in their test, the Indians see the truth in your words and agree to let the settlers go on their way. If less than
50% of the group are successful, then the Indians reluctantly agree to let the settlers go, but also see you as traitors to the tribe. Any
Hero with the keyword ‘Kemosabe’ loses that keyword. Each Hero recovers 1 Grit and gains an 25 XP for stopping the attack.

92aTurn awayGain 10 XP. As you turn your back on the raging inferno, you feel a heavy weight settle on your shoulders that haunts you til the
day you die. Your thoughts frequently return to this day when you turned away and did nothing, thinking what might have been
had you not been such a coward.
Take D6 Corruption Hits.
93aPass on byGain 10 XP. The sights and smell of the horrific scene are too much for you to endure, you would just as soon let braver men
search through that carnage.
94aThe LoversUpon arrival at the town, roll D6. The group finds out that:
1-3 Unfortunately the woman’s love died some time ago and there is nothing for her here except heartache.
Each Hero gains D6x50 XP.
4-6 Unfortunately the woman’s love died some time ago, but willed a sizable portion of his estate to her,
though no amount of money will ever replace the emptiness in her soul.
Each Hero gains 50 XP and D6x$50.
95aFollow the sign Gain 25 XP and stop all movement for the day. You follow the sign and enter into a hidden valley you never knew existed. The

bandido defeated, gain 10 XP. For each 3 bandidos that aren’t defeat, lose $50, D3 Dark Stone, or 1 Gear or Artifact (your choice).
97aMake an
offering to the
shrineGain 25 XP.
You don’t know what compels you, but you make a slashing cut on your hand and let the blood flow from your hand into the open mouth
of one of the figures on the totem shrine. As your life blood flows out from your palm a terrible coldness grips you from the inside and makes
you feel so completely small and insignificant in a vast and terrifying universe. You get the feeling that if you actually understood the true nature
behind this totem shrine it would drive you mad, but at the same time you feel as if some horrible thing has granted you a terrible boon.
Each Hero takes D6 Wounds, but the next time you are on an Adventure, you may draw two Darkness cards each time you are
required to and select which one you wish to have an effect, discard the other. This effect ends after the next Adventure.
98aIgnore the
head and keep
on movingGain 10 XP. As you mosey on past the great head, you think you hear the whirring of gears and the chittering of insects, but
you’re obviously just hearing things... aren’t you?
99aRefuse the deal
people there are warm and welcoming and literally glow with auras. Each Hero may visit any one Town Location they want to
at this secret town without rolling on the Location event chart. After that, you are compelled to leave this magical place, only to
discover that the entrance to the town has completely disappeared, along with any trace of the sign that lead you here.
Cunning 6+
If failed, gain D6+1 Corruption Points, ignoring Willpower. John Moulton vanishes in a puff of fire and brimstone, cursing your

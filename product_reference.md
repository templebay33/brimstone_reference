## What is Shadows of Brimstone?  
Shadows of Brimstone™  is a fully cooperative, dungeon crawl, adventure game, where a group of courageous Heroes explore a world overrun with unspeakable horrors. First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, the original Shadows of Brimstone™ Core boxes were set in the Old West. In 2016, the Forbidden Fortress™ Core box appeared as a second Kickstarter campaign, introducing elements of Feudal Japan to the Shadows of Brimstone game series.  

The  game supports 1-4 players (or up to 5-6 players with additional Heroes), has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit a settlement between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on  your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Earth-based environment on one side and an alien world on the other side.  

One of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone™  is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.  

## Game Miniatures  
The Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Gates of Valhalla  and Shadows of Brimstone: Valley of the Serpent Kings  are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.  

## Types of Products
Shadows of Brimstone is an expansive game system, offering players a wide world to explore. There are many different ways
to expand your collection and add variety to your Adventures.  

### Core Sets
The Core Sets for Shadows
of Brimstone are intended as an
entry point to the game, including
everything you need to play. Each
Core Set focuses on a different genre
(such as the Old West or Feudal
Japan), and is packed with a different set of content
including 4 Heroes, a host of ruthless Enemies, a full Map Tile
Set featuring a different alien World, 12 Missions, and all of the
rules, cards, and counters to start your Adventures.  

### Adventure Sets
Slightly smaller than a Core Set,
Adventure Sets feature a group of Team
Heroes (such as Vikings or Conquistadors)
that are a trained fighting force of warriors
and explorers. These sets can be used as
an entry point to the game, and include
everything needed to play. Featuring a host of deadly
Enemies, cards, and counters, each Adventure Set is based
around an 8 Mission narrative campaign and allows the
Heroes to build and grow their Expedition Camp throughout
the campaign.  

### OtherWorld Expansions
These large boxed expansions add new
alien Worlds for the Heroes to adventure in.
With a full new set of Map Tiles, new Enemies
themed for the new World, 6 new Missions,
and a Host of new cards and counters, each
OtherWorld Expansion is literally a whole new
World to explore.  

### Town Expansions
Greatly expanding on the Town Stay
between Adventures from the Core Sets, these
large boxed Expansions (such as Frontier Town
and Feudal Village) offer new Town Locations
to visit, different types of Towns that can be
encountered, and even add 6 new Missions and a large game
board for playing Adventures in the Town itself. Also included
are a new group of Enemies that are themed for the Town.  

### Enemy Packs
There are many different Enemy Packs
for Shadows of Brimstone, each adding new
hordes of foes to your game, or even larger
Enemies as Epic boss encounters. These
Enemy Packs include all of the miniatures, cards, counters, and
rules needed to add the new Enemies to your games. Many of
the larger Enemy Packs even include Missions as well.  

### Hero Packs
Hero Packs introduce new Hero Classes
to the game that can be added to your Hero
Party, and are a good way to increase the
Player Count of the game up to 5-6 Players.  
There are two types of Hero Packs -
New Heroes and Alt Gender Hero Packs. New
Heroes have all of the cards, rules, and Upgrade information
for playing as that new type of Hero, as well as both the Male
and Female Miniatures for them. Alt Gender Hero Packs are a
pack of 4 Heroes originally introduced in one of the Core Sets
or Adventure Sets, but include the alternate gender miniatures
for the Heroes that came with the associated Core/Adventure
Set. These Alt Gender Hero Packs also contain all of the
cards, rules, and Upgrade information needed to play as those
Heroes, allowing you to have a second player use the same
Hero Class, or to add these Heroes to your games, even if you
don’t yet have the Core Set/Adventure Set it is associated with.  

### Mission Packs
Each Mission Pack is a deep dive into a
new type of Enemy, including new Artifacts,
Gear, Encounters, Darkness, and Enemy
Trait cards themed for those Enemies, as
well as the miniatures and counters for them.
A special Adventure Card is also included,
allowing you to change existing Missions to
be themed for the new Enemy type. One of the main features of
each Mission Pack is a story-driven 4 Mission mini-campaign
heavily focused on the theme of these new Enemies.  

### Card Suppliments
On the official Flying Frog website (www.flyingfrog.net)
you can find additional content not available in stores. This
includes Dark Stone Forge resin terrain pieces with exciting
and thematic new Missions, miniatures for specific characters
of unique Enemies or Allies, and additional themed Card
Supplement packs that add new game mechanics and variety
to your Adventures.

This set also features the otherworldly Hell Train, itself; a nightmare locomotive that runs on rails of fire, barreling through the Void and burning its mark across all worlds! Flickering in and out of reality, the runaway Hell Train belches black smoke from its stacks, and the sound of its whistle splits the night as the thunderous rumble of its engine shakes the foundations of the earth as it approaches.

# Shadows of Brimstone - Design Reference
This document is a reference explaining some of the intentions and goals of the Shadows of Bristone game design. It can be useful as a companion reference document to the actual rules, explaining the tone, goals, and intentions behind the design of the rules and thematic elements. This can be helpful for understanding the official rules better, as well as how to modify them with custom house rules and new mechanics to be aligned with the rest of the game. This guide is especially helpful for Large Language Models and future AI's as additional training and reference data so that the AI may assist in interpreting rules, creating new rules and mechanics, and playing the role of a Game Master for human players.

Most of the text of this document has been taken from various articles, interviews, and other posts by the games designers. Short design-focused articles that were published during the various Kickstarter campaigns were especially helpful in adding to the data here.

## How Does the Game Play?
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself. You set out on your expeditions exploring a torch-lit Spanish Fort that has been overrun with creatures and demons, or the snowy forests of the Norse Lands, filled with mythological beasts!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from a nearby settlement by demons and carried off into the darkness, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!

1-4 Players (or up to 5-6 Players if Adventure Sets are combined together or with additional Hero Expansions) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class and Starting Upgrade to play, such as the Conquistador Explorer or Viking Raider.

Once your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party’s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the shadows (at the opposite end of the track). Players then draw their Team Ability cards to add to their shared pool for the Hero Party.

At the start of each turn, the Hero with the Light Source (Lantern or Torch) rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping from the shadows! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!

Heroes now Activate in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero’s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though a die may generally not be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.

After moving, a Hero may attack if there are any Enemies on the board, or if not in a Fight, they may Explore by either Scavenging the area for anything of value (rolling 3 dice and drawing a card from the Scavenge deck for each 6 rolled), or Looking Through a Doorway, if standing on an open exit of a Map Tile. To Look Though a Doorway, you must be in one of the puzzle-cut half spaces of an open exit from the map tile you are on. You may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party’s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the unknown. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper into the shadows, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).

Newly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not Scavenge or Look Through a Doorway on that Map Tile (you can’t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!

While exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Earth-based world on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Gates of Valhalla, the alien World included is the Targa Plateau - Library! In Valley of the Serpent Kings, the OtherWorld is the Swamps of Jargono - Valley of the Serpent Kings. Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves in the halls of a dark archive deep within a frozen ancient alien city, or the sprawling tribal temples and crumbling stone ruins covered in vines and sunken into the water of the murky swamps.

Once the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!

Between Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to their Expedition Camp to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Camp before setting out on the next Mission. 

Shadows of Brimstone has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.

## Traps in The Lost Tombs
One of the biggest features of exploring lost temples and tombs in pulp adventure is the idea that they are littered with booby traps and all manner of deadly challenges that the explorers must face as the delve deeper into the hidden chambers and twisting passageways.

This could have been accomplished within the normal framework of the game, using Encounters and Darkness cards, but we wanted this to be a larger feature of this Core Set, creating not just more detailed Traps, but also more elaborate Solutions for how the Heroes get out of them! This lead to a 3 part system when a Trap is triggered (which can happen based on Encounters, Darkness cards, even a Depth Event result can lead to a Trap!) - Draw a Trap card to see what the specific Trap is, use the Trap Type large Reference card for the general details of that Type of Trap, and draw a medium size Trap Solution card that details what the Heroes need to do to escape or disarm the Trap!

This gives a lot of variability in the different Trap Types we can have, combined with the specific details of the particular Trap drawn, and then a variable Solution for the Heroes to overcome. It also leaves a lot of design space for easily adding more new Trap Types and Trap Solutions in the future.

One of our main goals with the new Traps game mechanic was to create an experience for the Heroes that was as exciting, tactically challenging, and detailed as a Fight, but without the Enemies. (Note that a few of the Traps in the Trap deck are marked as using the Dangerous Hazard Trap Type. These are not as detailed and represent the simple damage dealing Traps, like gouts of flame bursting out of the floor, poison darts, or skewering spears. These are more like traditional Encounters, using the Heroes' Skills to avoid the danger, and usually having a penalty that involves taking long lasting Status Effect markers like Bleeding, Burning, etc. These are mixed in to keep the Heroes guessing, but also work well as a subset of the deck, if you want to have a faster or lighter Trap experience for an Adventure).

### Gameplay Example of a Trap
Here is a quick gameplay example of a Trap in action.

Our 4 daring Heroes move through the tombs in search of a Lost Relic. As the Archaeologist Hero Explores, looking through the Door ahead, the Broken Corridor Map Card is drawn and the Map Tile is placed, as well as a facedown Exploration Token on that Map Tile. The other Heroes move up cautiously (except for the Soldier of Fortune, who often runs headlong into a new Room, ready for a Fight).

When the Exploration Token is revealed at the end of the Turn, there is 1 Door Icon meaning a Random Exit of the Map Tile is an Open Doorway (an End Cap is used to block off the remaining potential Exit from the Map Tile). The Exploration Token also has the Heroes draw a Lost Tombs Encounter card - Shafts of Light. As listed on the card, the Heroes must choose as a group, Avoid the Light or Solve the Puzzle. They decide to Solve the Puzzle using their Skills, but unfortunately, they don't all succeed at the the tests they are required to make and failing the Encounter triggers a Trap!

The Heroes draw a Trap card and discover the Room Filling with Sand! 

Using the *Room Filling* Trap Type, it notes that all of the Heroes not on the Map Tile are immediately moved into the Room the shortest distance to not be on a puzzle-cut doorway space. It also blocks off the Entrance as well as all other open Doorways with a Stone Slab marker that slides down into place, covering the Puzzle-Cut spaces. The Heroes are Trapped!

Next on the Room Filling Trap Type Reference card it has the players place a Fill marker in every interior corner of the Room, including where the End Cap was placed (the Stone Slabs do not count as Walls for this). In this case the Fill markers used are Sand Fill markers, as noted on the Trap card that was drawn).

The Heroes now draw a Trap Solution medium size card to determine what they need to do to disarm the Trap before they are buried and crushed by the cascading Sand that pours in all around them!

They draw *Find the Pressure Plate*.

To complete the Solution and disarm the Trap, the Heroes need to scatter around the Room and use their Luck skill to place Scavenged markers in every space of the Map Tile! But remember, the Room Filling with Sand Trap card noted that the Sand Fill markers slow down the Heroes' movement in spaces that it covers, and even more so once every space on the Map Tile has a Sand Fill marker in it. It's a race against the clock!

The Heroes spread out and start using their Luck to place Scavenged markers as they desperately search for the Pressure Plate. But, as noted on the Room Filling Reference card, at the end of each Turn, every space on the Map Tile that is adjacent to a space with a Fill marker, also gets a Fill marker (limit 1 per space), as the Sand begins to fill the Room.

The Heroes continue to make Luck tests and place Scavenged markers around the board, until the last space has one, and that will be the location of the Pressure Plate. But as listed on the Room Filling Trap Type Reference card, once every space of the Map Tile has a Sand Fill marker, the Heroes start taking increasing Damage every Turn as they are buried alive. It's going to be close! 

According to the Trap Solution, even once the Heroes find the Pressure Plate, they still need to use their Strength to disable it before being crushed by the sand.

...and we leave our Heroes in a Cliffhanger! Will they find the Pressure Plate and disarm it in time? Or will they become just another relic added to this Lost Tomb, buried in the desert sands of Egypt?

As you can see, the Traps in the Lost Tombs of Khamuntet are a really dynamic and exciting new addition to Shadows of Brimstone that is quintessential to the 1930's Pulp genre, and this is just one example of a Trap Card, Trap Type, and Trap Solution combo. There is still a lot more to explore!

## Team Heroes
With the new Team Hero Classes introduced in Brimstone Adventure Sets, all of the Heroes of the same Hero Class (Conquistador or Viking) share the same basic set of abilities, but each player chooses which of the 4 starting Upgrades for that Hero Class to use, giving them a Sub-Class - A Conquistador  may be an Explorer, Duelist, El Capitan, or Soldier; while a Viking may be a Jarl chieftan, Raider, Berserker, or Huscarl. This defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your weapons, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also gives you a unique starting ability and defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a War Axe, a shield and sword, Dueling Blades? Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more ‘character’.

One other exciting element to the new Team Heroes is the Team Hero Abilities deck. At the start of each Adventure, the players draw one card from the Viking Team Abilities deck for each Viking Hero in the party, and adds it to a shared pool of cards. Each of these cards is a special ability that can be used once during the Adventure, and generally gives all Heroes of that type a bonus.  You must choose as a team when best to use them. In this way, the more Vikings you have on a team, the more Team Ability cards you get to draw at the start of each Adventure to help all Viking Heroes! This works the same way for the Conquistadors, and allows for thematic and heroic teamwork between all the characters in the Hero Party that are of the same Hero Class.

## Enemies

### Thunderforged Titan
The Thunderforged Titan is one of the tallest Enemies in the game, towering over the Heroes. The head of its massive Underworld Hammer alone is larger than most Heroes, allowing it to crush foes at a distance of up to 6 spaces away with its Melee Attacks, and causing Combat Hits to Heroes adjacent to the target as well. With a hefty Armor 4+ save, the titan shrugs off most damage, while crackling with Bound Lightning that electrifies adjacent Heroes when they assign Critical Hits to the titan (note that a Hero that rolls a Critical Hit may elect not to assign that Hit to avoid the Bound Lightning).

In addition, the Thunderforged Titan wields an entire deck of deadly Titanic Devastation cards to wreak havoc on the Heroes, while causing Fiery Eruptions of molten magma to burst from the ground whenever the Hold Back the Darkness roll is failed.

The Thunderforged Titan’s Hammer of the Underworld ability allows it to make Melee Attacks on a Hero up to six spaces away. In addition, for each successful Hit on the target, every other Hero adjacent to the target also takes one Combat Hit from the Titan. This means that the Heroes must spread out if they want to avoid getting crushed by each swing of the mighty hammer. Another devastating effect of the Underworld Hammer is that the Thunderforged Titan’s Melee To Hit rolls of 6+ are -1 Defense for the Hero. This includes the extra Combat Hit caused to other Heroes adjacent to the target for that Hit.

One of the more deadly abilities of the Thunderforged Titan is the Fiery Eruption of magma that happens whenever the Hold Back the Darkness roll is failed during the fight. This selects D3-1 Random Heroes for an Eruption marker to be placed in their space. Then each of these Eruption markers Bounces three times to find its final position (each of these is a normal Bounce, using the D8 to determine a Random adjacent space to move to if possible). Once the markers have Bounced, any Hero that is in the same or an adjacent space to 1 or more Eruption markers takes D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense.

There is a new Mission included in this XXL Enemy pack, allowing the Heroes to face off with one of these terrifying titans from the Underworld.  It is called "Twilight of the Gods", and the Heroes must track the Thunderforged Titan that has emerged from the Underworld, and defeat it before it wreaks havoc on the realms of gods and men!

### Setaris Ravagers
The Setaris Kitewings were first introduced in the Conquest of Planet Earth board game as one of the many Alien Races that players could control in their bid to conquer 1950's Earth. A reptilian species, the Setaris soar through the sky with their swooping wings and lashing tails, chittering and cawing to each other through their long vicious beaks filled with razor sharp teeth. But do not let their savage and monstrous demeanor fool you; they are an advanced civilization, ruthless in their desire for conquest, wielding dangerous technologies and armed with powerful weapons.


Though not particularly tough, the Setaris Ravagers can strike fast and hard, blasting the Heroes with their Setaris Laser Rifles before closing in to scratch and claw with their talons. These sinister Enemies use the rules for Snap Fire,  giving them the opportunity to make a free Ranged Attack each turn before closing in on the Heroes to use their Combat; then falling back to a distance to be ready to start the process again the following turn. And, with their Masters of Snap Fire ability, the Ravagers are even harder to pin down than other Enemies that use Snap Fire. They are also quite fast as they fly through the air, evading damage with their Agile Dodge.

As Alien pirates, enclaves of Setaris Ravagers can be found across the  galaxy, looting and pillaging travelers and settlements, then disappearing as quickly as they arrived. To represent this, the Setaris  Ravagers Enemy Pack includes OtherWorld Threat Cards for encountering them in the Swamps of Jargono, Blasted Wastes, the Targa Plateau, and the Derelict Ship, as well as the standard Threat cards for Low, Med, and High threats.

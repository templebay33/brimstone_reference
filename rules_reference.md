# Shadows of Brimstone - Rules Compilation

This is a text reference of rules compilation for Shadows of Brimstone. The core game rules across all Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been merged into a single reference that is not specific to any particular Core Set or Adventure Set. Additional rules across expansions is also included. The only rules not included in this reference are text on various game cards, charts, Missions, Hero Sheets, and Enemy Reference Sheets. These references can be found in separate documents.  

Note that many of the official game rules in PDF and printed format include visual elements such as icons, thematic artwork, graphic design elements, and diagrams that are not included in this text-only version of the rules.  

This text-only version of the rules is intended to be easily referenced by AI models as training data and reference information for context. As a result, the formatting may be more flat and simple, but less visually readable for humans.  

Since many AI models cannot currently work with other data types than text (such as images, video, and audio), important image data for explaining the rules are given text keywords with text-based descriptions. These visual elements, such as icons, tokens, markers, and diagrams, are summarized with a keyword or letter in curly braces {} throughout the rules. As a short-hand, text descriptions of each symbol and other visual element is provided for AI models in the list below:  

- {P}: Peril Die Icon. This depicts a yellow 6-sided die. The Peril Die is larger and physically distinct from the other D6 dice that come with the game, and has embossed number values with a worn, frayed background etched into the die. The Peril Die does not use standard 1-6 values, but instead has the following values on its 6 faces: 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. Whenever the game official game rules display a visual icon of the Peril Die, this reference will use {P} instead.
- {C}: Clue Icon. Clue icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens. Visually the look like a small red circle with a white exclamation mark in the center and a bit of drop shadow around the circle. Clue icons can have a somewhat abstract meaning depending on the context of the mission being played. Most missions will assign some special meaning to Clue Icons found on Exploration Tokens during a Mission.
- {Gate}: Gate Icon. Gate icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate that there is a gate instead of a door connected to the currently explored Map Tile which leads to an OtherWorld. The gate icon itself looks like a circular swirl of blue light.  
- {Door}: Door icon. Door icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate the number of doorways on the currently explored Map Tile are open and lead to more Map Tiles. All other puzzle-cut edges of a Map Tile are closed with an End Cap tile if they do not depict either a Door or a Gate.
- {One Hero}: One Hero icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a skill test to indicate that a single Hero chosen by the players must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with the white silhouette of a person in the center.
- {All Heroes}: All Heroes icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that all Heroes must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with one white silhouette of a person in the center and two additional grey silhouettes on either side of the white one.
- {One Random}: One Random icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that a Hero must be chosen at random to take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with a white question mark on the left and a white silhouette of a person on the right.
- {One Handed}: One Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires one hand available to be equipped. It looks like a square icon of a worn slab of wood with a black hand icon in the center foreground.
- {Double Handed}: Double Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires both hands to be available to be equipped. It looks like a rectangular icon of a worn slab of wood with two black hand icons in the foreground, side by side.
- {Anvil}: Weight icon. Indicates units of weight of a particular item if carried by a Hero. The icon is transparent and has no background, but it in the simple shape of a black anvil as seen from a side perspective.
- {Dark Stone}: Dark Stone icon. Often indicates that an Item is charged with Dark Stone energy and will require a Hero carrying the item to occasionally take Corruption Hits. It looks like a round circular icon with a dark purple background and a white chunk of crystal in the center foreground.
- {Upgrade Slot}: Upgrade Slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is able to be upgraded and has upgrade capacity equal to the number of slots depicted on the icon. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots depicted. The icon looks like a horizontal series of circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series.
- {Upgrade Required Slot}: Upgrade required slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is itself an upgrade, and will occupy a number of Upgrade Slots depicted by the icon when attached to an item. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots required. The icon looks like a horizontal series of filled in circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series of circles. 

## Game Overview
Shadows of Brimstone is a fast-paced, Cooperative, dungeon-crawl boardgame with set in a variety of fantastic worlds. Each player creates a character. Forming a party of Heroes, the players take their characters on great adventures.  

Missions are designed for maximum replayability as everything you encounter, including the board layout, is dynamically generated as the story unfolds. Explore the various worlds and locations, overcoming dangerous encounters and fighting ruthless creatures, while collecting useful Gear and ancient Artifacts to aid in your adventures. Heroes can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their expedition on the other side.  

With a robust campaign system, Hero characters can be kept from game to game, earning experience and going up in levels to increase their skills and gain new abilities. The Heroes can also visit Towns, and sometimes Cities and Expedition Camps, spending their hard earned money on goods and services.  

So unfurl the sails, take up your sword, and strap on your armor, the Darkness closes in, adventure awaits!  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. If combining a Core Set or Adventure Set with another Core Set or additional Hero Packs, this can be increased to 5-6 players. All of the players work together against the game itself and the difficulty is scaled based on the number of Heroes taking part in each adventure.

## Dice
The game comes with 16 standard six-sided dice (8 White and 8 Red) that should be divided amongst the players. There are two colors of dice included, as often players will want to roll a group of dice together with some of them being special (ex. - “the Red dice are for Critical Hits”). Often cards will refer to the terms D6 and D3. D6 is just another name for a six-sided die. D3 means to roll a six-sided die using the following results:  

- 1-2 = 1
- 3-4 = 2
- 5-6 = 3

### Re-rolls
There are many things in the game that let you Re-roll one or more dice. It is important to note though that:  
**You may not Re-roll the same die more than once.**  

### 8-Sided Die
The game also comes with an 8-sided die which is used for some special rolls. This die is often referred to as a D8.  

### Peril Die {P}
There is also a larger, special six-sided die included called the Peril Die. This die is marked with the numbers 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. It is most often used for determining the quantity of Enemies during an attack, and is represented on cards as a {P} symbol.  

## Wounds and Sanity Damage
Red Wound Markers are placed on Heroes and Enemies to keep track of how much damage they have taken during the game, while blue Sanity markers are placed on Heroes to show how much Sanity Damage they have taken. There are individual Wound/Sanity Markers as well as larger markers representing 5 Wounds/Sanity each.  

## Ability Tokens
The term Ability Token is used to refer to
any of the various special tokens used by Hero
Classes to trigger their unique abilities.  

## Ambition Tokens
Conquistador Heroes use a special Ability Token called Ambition. Similar to Grit, it allows them a Re-roll, but for just a single die, with a powerful bonus.  

## Dark Stone
These markers are used to keep track of Dark Stone shards that Heroes find on their adventures.  

## Grit
Grit is a resource that Heroes have that can be used for Re-rolling dice, activating special abilities, or adding a burst of speed to your movement. 

Grit is a resource that represents a Hero’s
ability to tough out difficult situations and pull
off amazing feats; dodging a fatal blow at the
last minute, scoring a particularly difficult hit,
or activating a powerful special ability to save
the day. In short, it allows Heroes to be heroic!
Every Hero has Grit (they wouldn’t be much of
a Hero without it).  

### Using Grit
A Hero may use a Grit to do one of three things:
- Use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of dice that your
Hero just rolled.
- Use 1 Grit to add an extra D6 to your Hero’s
Movement.
- Use Grit to activate a Special Ability or Item that
requires it.


### Re-roll Limits
Grit can be very useful for Re-rolling dice when you need
to, but it is important to remember that no single die may ever
be Re-rolled more than once. So, for example, you CANNOT
Re-roll all of your misses with a Grit, and then use an ability or
spend another Grit to Re-roll the ones that still missed.
Grit may only be used to Re-roll dice that have been
rolled for your Hero (not other Heroes, Enemies, etc).
In Addition, Grit may not be used on any roll on a Chart
or the roll to Hold Back the Darkness (more on that later).  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is a very powerful resource, but is limited. Each
Hero starts every Mission with 1 Grit, but more can be gained
throughout the Adventure. The most common way to Recover
a Grit is by rolling a 1 for your Move roll. This is covered in
greater detail later in the section on Hero Activation.  

### Max Grit
Every Hero Class has a Max Grit listed on their Character
Sheet. This is generally Max Grit 2 for most new Heroes.
Max Grit is simply the most Grit your Hero can have at one
time.  

If you are already at your Max Grit and you would get to
Recover a Grit, though you can’t hold onto it, you are allowed
to immediately spend that new Grit instead of just losing it.
This is most often used to activate an ability that costs Grit or
to gain the extra D6 to your Move for the turn.  

## Corruption
During the game, Heroes can gain Corruption Points, slowly pushing them down the path of evil and mutation.  

## Exploration Tokens
These markers are placed face down in new rooms discovered as the Heroes explore and, when revealed, tell the number of exits a room has as well as if there are any Encounters or Enemies to be overcome there. Some also have a {C} Clue Icon.  

## Side Bags and Side Bag Tokens
Each Hero has a Side Bag that can carry helpful Tokens for them such as Bandages, Rum, or Bombs.  

## Deuling Tactics
An assortment of Dueling Tactics markers are
included to represent the different tactics that Heroes
can practice in Camp to unleash on their foes in
battle.  

## Scavenged Markers
These markers are used to show when a
Map Tile has been successfully Scavenged by the
Heroes for anything of value.  

## Revive Tokens
These tokens are occasionally used to give
Heroes an extra chance at survival, allowing a
Hero that was just KO’d to get back up
without long-lasting effects.  

## Creeping Shadows
Creeping Shadows are a type of Enemy, that
emerges from the darkness to swarm the Heroes
and attack them from within their space.  

## Hero and KO'd Hero Markers
Hero markers can be used for determining a Random
Hero from the group. KO’d Hero markers are placed in the
space where a Hero was KO’d.  

## Depth Track
The Depth Track represents the general path of the Heroes and tracks how deep the Hero Party has journeyed into the wild, and how close the Darkness is to escaping and wreaking havoc on the countryside (resulting in failure for the Heroes). At the start of the game, the Hero Party marker is placed at the Entrance space on the far left of the track, while the Darkness marker is placed on the Darkness Start space on the far right.  

During the course of the game, the Hero Party marker moves down the track every time a new Map Tile is placed, as the Heroes travel deeper and deeper into the dark. The Darkness marker moves the opposite direction, up the track, as the Heroes fail to hold the Darkness at bay.  

### Visual Description of the Depth Track
The Depth Track is a flat, rectangular cardboard component about 7cm high and 22.5cm wide. Each Core Set and Adventure Set includes a cardboard Depth Track in the box, visually themed with graphic design elements to match the setting of the Core/Adventure box. Deluxe Depth track expansions are also available made out of Resin or Plastic that are 3D and intended to be painted. No matter which Depth Track is in use thematically, the spaces and mechanics are all the same no matter which one is being used. The visual style and build material of the component is purely aesthetic.  

The Depth track consists of spaces spread out horizontally across the width (22.5cm) of the track. Each "space" is a colored circle with a designated number in the center. The circular spaces are vertically staggered in an alternating pattern, such that next space to the left or right of the current space is at a diagonal angle.  

The first space on the left edge of the Depth Track is not numbered, and is labled the Entrance Space. The last space on the right edge of the Depth Track is also not numbered and is labled the Darkness Start space. All other circular space between the Entrance and Darkness Start spaces are numbered. The numbers start at 15 on the left side of the track (15 is the first space to the right of the Entrance space), and descend to space 1 on the right side of the track (the first space to the left of the Darkness Start space is the 1 space).  In this way, the numbers from left to right descend from 15 to 1.  

Spaces 15, 11, and 6 are additionally marked as Growing Dread spaces. This indicates that when the Darkness Marker reaches these spaces, a random Growing Dread card is added face-down to the Growing Dread Stack without the players looking.  

Spaces 13, 10, 8, 4, and 2 have an artistic border around the circumference of the circular space that looks like a blood spatter. These spaces are referred to as "Blood Spatter" spaces on the Depth Track and indicate that a random Darkness Card is drawn and resolved whenever the Darkness Marker lands on a Blood Spatter space.  

There are two verital lines that separate the Darkness Track into 3 stages. The first vertical line is between spaces 11 and 10, the second is between spaces 6 and 5. This separates the Depth Track into three stages. Each secton has a number at the bottom of the track. These numbers from the left side to the right side of the track are: 7+, 8+, and 9+. These numbers indicate the value that the player holding the Light Source must meet or exceed on a 2d6 roll when Holding Back the Darkness, depending on which of the 3 stages the Hero Party Marker is currently located. This would mean that if the Hero Party Marker is on the Entrance or spaces 15-11 a 7+ would need to be rolled, if the Hero Party Marker in on spaces 10-6 an 8+ would need to be rolled, and if the Hero Party Marker is on spaces 5-1 or the Darkness Start space, a 9+ would need to be rolled.  

### Stages of the Track
The Depth Track is broken into 3 Stages, and each Stage has a value printed at the bottom (the Top Stage 7+, Middle Stage 8+, and Bottom Stage 9+). As the Hero Party marker moves down the track, it passes through these different Stages, making it progressively harder for the Heroes to Hold Back the Darkness.  

### Holding Back the Darkness
At the start of each Turn, the Hero with the Light Source must roll a Hold Back  the Darkness test. The Hero rolls 2D6 and adds them together. If the number is equal to or greater than the value needed (listed at the bottom of the Stage that the Hero Party marker is currently in), the Darkness has been held and the marker does not move this turn. If the roll is less than the value needed, the Darkness moves one step forward on the track (closer to the Entrance). The Hero Party may only have one Light Source active at a time.  

Important: Grit may **not** be used to Re-roll a Hold Back the Darkness test!  

### Blood Spatter Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Blood Spatter space, the Heroes must immediately draw a Darkness card as the Darkness has grown stronger.  

### Growing Dread Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Growing Dread space, the Heroes must draw a Growing Dread card as the deadly nature of the Hero’s mission sinks in. 

Blood Spatter and Growing Dread spaces only matter for the Darkness Marker, not the Hero Party Marker.  

### Depth Events
Any time the Hero with the Light Source rolls natural doubles for the Hold Back the Darkness test, a Depth Event has occurred! Even if the roll would normally have failed, instead of moving the Darkness marker, consult the Depth Event Chart to see what has happened (the Depth Event Chart can be found on one of the large reference cards).  

There are 6 possible results on the chart, and the Event that has occurred is the one listed for the double number that was rolled (double 1s = 1 on the chart, double 2s = 2 on the chart, etc). This is usually something bad that has happened.  

Occasionally something else will require a Depth Event to be triggered (such as an Exploration Token). When this happens, simply roll a D6 to see which Depth Event is triggered.  

### Darkness Marker
This marks the current position of the Darkness on the Depth Track and moves up the track over the course of the game, as the Darkness tries to escape! The Darkness Marker always starts on the Darkness Start space unless Mission special rules say otherwise.      

### Hero Party Marker
This marks the current position of the Heroes on the Depth Track and moves down the track as the Heroes explore the map. The Hero Party Marker always starts on the Entrance space, unless Mission special rules say otherwise.

## The Game Turn
Each Game Turn has four steps that are completed in the
following order:  

1. Hold Back the Darkness
2. Models Activate in Initiative Order
3. Room Exploration
4. End of the Turn

Once all 4 steps are complete, a new Game Turn begins.  

### Hold Back the Darkness
As noted earlier, at the start of each turn, the Hero that has
the Light Source must roll the Hold Back the Darkness test
to prevent the Darkness marker from moving forward on the
Depth Track. This test occurs at the start of every turn (even
during a Fight), and the longer the Adventure goes, the harder
it is to hold the Darkness back.  

### Models Activate in Initiative Order
After the Hold Back the Darkness test is complete, each
model is Activated in order of Initiative, from highest to lowest.
A model’s Initiative can be found in the upper right corner of
their Hero Character Sheet or Enemy Record Sheet.  

During most turns of the game, only Heroes will be on
the board as they explore the map. During a Fight however,
Activations will often be intermixed between Heroes and
Enemies, based on their relative Initiative scores (more on
Enemies and Fights later).  

Heroes that are tied for Initiative may decide
between them who will go first, and this may be
changed from turn to turn.  

### Room Exploration
When the Heroes discover a new Room Map Tile, it has
an Exploration Token placed on it. Exploration Tokens like
this are revealed and resolved during the Room Exploration
step (note that Passage Map Tiles do not have an Exploration
Token as indicated on each Passage Map Card).  

### End of the Turn
After all models have been Activated and any new Rooms
have been explored, anything that occurs at the End of the
Turn happens. If there are multiple effects that trigger at the
End of the Turn, the Heroes may decide what order to do
them in.  

## Hero Activation
When a Hero is Activated, they may Move and then
either Search or make an Attack. Searching may NOT be
done during a Fight (as the Hero is a little busy).  

### Hero Movement
At the start of a Hero’s Activation, the first thing they
should do is to roll a single D6 for Movement. The Hero
may Move a number of spaces up to the amount rolled on
the die.  

Models have no facing and may move forward, back, side
to side, and even diagonally. Models may NOT move through
other models or through Walls, and may only move into valid
spaces on the board (it must be at least 50% of a full space, to
be considered a valid space).  

The two half-spaces of an open-ended puzzle connection
on a Map Tile are considered to be Doorways and models
MAY move into these half-spaces.  

If a Hero rolls a 1 on their Move roll, they
are allowed to Recover one Grit. This is the
main method for Heroes getting Grit during
the game. If a Hero is already at their Max
Grit, they may immediately use the new Grit
on the spot, usually to add an extra D6 to their
Movement.  

Note that using Grit to add an extra D6 to your movement
does not let you Recover another Grit if you roll a 1 on that
D6, as it is simply extra movement, not a Move roll.  

### Map Tile Puzzle Connections
It is important to note that a Hero standing in a puzzle
connection space (between two Map Tiles) counts as being on
both of those Map Tiles. This can be important for Abilities
or effects that target every model on a specific Map Tile.  

### Barriers
Some spaces on the board have one
or more edges with a thick, white line.
These are called Barriers and usually
represent elevation changes or obstacles
that prevent movement but can be seen
through, such as cliffs or low walls.  

Only models that have an ability allowing them to ‘Move
through other models’ may cross these Barrier space edges
during their move. This usually includes models that can fly,,
models that have the ability to leap or climb over obstacles, or
XL-sized Enemies that can smash through them.  

When a Barrier extends slightly beyond the cross point
of multiple spaces, it prevents normal diagonal movement that
would cross this extended end of the Barrier as well.  

Barriers have NO EFFECT on Line of Sight for Ranged
Attacks, adjacency for Escape tests, or Melee Attacks; they
ONLY affect movement. Barriers do NOT prevent random
directional movement using the Bounce chart.  

If a model that can’t move through Barriers ever finds
itself trapped in an area surrounded by Walls/Barriers, it may
move through a Barrier to get out.  

### Walls Blocking Diagonal Movement
As noted above, models may not move or see through
Walls (the thick black border around every Map Tile).
Sometimes a Wall will extend into a Map Tile, covering over
the grid cross point between spaces.  

Walls like this prevent models from moving diagonally
across that Wall. In addition, because the Wall extends between
these diagonal spaces (covering the cross point of the spaces),
the two spaces are NOT considered to be adjacent to one
another. Walls like this block Line of Sight for Ranged Attacks,
prevent diagonal Melee Attacks across them, and prevent other
things like Fear or requiring Escape tests to move away from
Enemies that are diagonally across the Wall.  

### The Light Source and Voices in the Dark
The light from the Light Source is the only safety from the
shadows. It illuminates the entire Map Tile that the Hero
carrying it is currently on, as well as every adjacent Map
Tile. (Note that this includes every individual space on each of
these Map Tiles, regardless of Walls, Line of Sight, etc).  

Any Hero starting their Activation on a Map Tile that is
not within this light (on the same or adjacent Map Tile as the
Light Source) begins hearing ‘Voices in the Dark’, slowly
driving them mad. That Hero immediately takes D6 Horror
Hits.  

### Searching
There are two different types of Searching a Hero can do at
the end of their Movement, when not in a Fight - Scavenging
or Looking through a Door. Note that you may do either of
these things, not both.  

A Hero may not Search on a Map Tile (Scavenge or Look Through a Door) while there is an unrevealed Exploration
Token on that Tile (more on Exploration Tokens later).  

### Scavenging
Any Hero that ends their Move on a Map
Tile (Room, Passage, or the Entrance) that has
not yet been fully Scavenged may attempt to
search the area for anything of value.  

To Scavenge a Map Tile, roll 3 dice. If any of
the dice roll a 6, you have successfully Scavenged the area and
found something! Place a Scavenged marker on the Map Tile.
Then draw one card from the Scavenge Deck for each 6 that
was rolled. Note - only 1 Scavenged marker is placed, regardless
of how many 6s were rolled.  

As noted before, there is no discard pile for the Scavenge
Deck. Each time a Hero needs to draw one or more Scavenge
cards, shuffle the entire Scavenge Deck to draw the number of
cards needed. Note that the Scavenge Deck is approximately
1/3 good, 1/3 bad, and 1/3 nothing, so Scavenging may not
always end up being a benefit to your Hero (but it’s usually
fun to try).  

Each Map Tile may be Scavenged a number of times,
based on how many Heroes are in the Hero Party, before it is
considered fully Scavenged (and may not be Scavenged again).  

- 1-2 Heroes: 1 Scavenge
- 3-4 Heroes: 2 Scavenge
- 5-6 heroes: 3 Scavenge

### Looking Through a Door
Open-ended puzzle connections on a Map Tile (not
blocked off with an End Cap) are considered to be Doors. A
Hero that ends their Move on one of these open-ended puzzle
connection half-spaces may Search by Looking Through the
Door, seeing into the next Map Tile.  

Draw a Map Card and place the Map Tile shown as the
next piece of the board, connected to the Door that the Hero
is looking through. The green arrow on the card shows the
‘Entrance’ to the new Map Tile that should be connected to
the Door.  

If the new Map Tile cannot be placed because it would
overlap an existing Map Tile, rotate the tile to use one of the
other exits as the Entrance. If the tile still does not fit, discard
it and draw a new Map Card to repeat the same process. If the
second Map Tile also does not fit, this exit is not a valid Door
and should be blocked with an End Cap. Any exit that clearly
cannot fit a Map Tile should not be counted when determining
which exits from the Room are Doors (as described in the
section on Exploration below).  

Whenever a new Map Tile is placed, move
the Hero Party marker one step forward on the
Depth Track, showing their progression deeper
into the unexplored area.  

Any time a Hero Looks Through a Door and places a
new Map Tile, that Hero gains 5 XP for exploring.  

The Hero Party marker will no longer move if it ever
reaches the Darkness Start space of the Depth Track.  

Note that Heroes may not look through Doors while
there are Enemies on the board as Searching cannot be
performed during a Fight.  

### Hero Attacks
During their Activation, after moving, a Hero is allowed
to make one Attack. This is covered later in the section on
Fights.  

## Exploration
Exploration is a big part of Shadows of Brimstone, and
allows the Heroes an element of discovery as they pick their
way through the dark halls and rooms of the unexplored area.  

There are two types of Map Tiles, Passages and Rooms.
Passages are short pathways that simply connect different areas
together. Rooms, on the other hand, often hold Encounters or
Enemies that the Heroes must face.  

Whenever a Room Map Tile is placed, draw an
Exploration Token without looking at it and place
it face down on that Map Tile. Passages do not
contain Exploration Tokens and are labeled as such
on their individual Map Cards.  

Once the Map Tile is placed, the Hero that looked through
the Door will be standing in a puzzle connection space that is
half on each Map Tile. As noted above, a Hero on a puzzle
connection space like this is considered to be on BOTH Map
Tiles. This means that during the Room Exploration step of the
turn (after all Heroes have Activated), this Exploration Token
will be revealed as there will be at least one Hero on the Map
Tile with it.  

### Revealing Exploration Tokens
When an Exploration Token is revealed
(after all Heroes have Activated), flip it over
so that all players can see what has been
discovered! An Exploration Token has three
important pieces of information – Door / Gate
Icons (showing the Number of exits the
Room has), Encounters or Attacks!, and if
there are any Clues for the Heroes’ current
Mission. There are also Exploration Tokens
that draw a Darkness card (more on Darkness
later) or have the Heroes roll a Depth Event.  

### Door/Gate Icons
At the top of the Exploration Token you
will find one or more Door Icons {Door}. Each Icon
represents an exit from the Room. So if there
are 2 Door Icons on the Token, there will be 2
Random puzzle connection ‘Doors’ left open on
the Room. On the Map Card for the Room, each
potential exit is marked with a set of numbers to
help randomly determine where the Doors are to be left open.
For each Door Icon, roll a die and consult the Map Card
to determine where that Door will be (roll again if there is
already a Door there). Each puzzle connection exit that is not
a Door should be closed off using an End Cap piece.  

Additional rules for Gates {Gate} are covered in a later section.  

### Encounters and Attack!
Exploration Tokens will always lead to Encounters or an
Attack, both of which are covered a little later on.  

### Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens
The Exploration Token with Darkness
on it requires the Heroes to draw a Darkness
card, while the Token with a Depth Event has
the Heroes roll a D6 and trigger the Depth
Event that corresponds to the number rolled.  

### Clue Icons
Many of the Exploration Tokens have Clue Icons {C}
on them, representing important bits of information
that help the Heroes on their Mission. Clue Icons have
different meanings based on the particular Mission being
played, as described in the Mission entry of the Adventure
Book (some Missions do not use Clue Icons at all).  

### Finding the Objective
When the final Clue Icon needed is found (or whatever
the particular Mission calls for is discovered), the Heroes have
found their Objective!  

This usually means that the Heroes ignore any Door Icons
and Encounters/Attacks on the final Exploration Token (Note
that the Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens still
trigger the Darkness/Depth Event). Instead, the Heroes have
reached their goal and must face a final fight with a larger or
meaner group of Enemies. In the Advanced Game, this comes
in the form of an Epic Threat boss fight. In the introductory
Mission, ‘Scouting Party’, it means fighting a higher level Threat
card of Enemies than normal.  

## Visual Description of Map Tiles
The physical Map Tile components are described in this section so they may assist an AI in understanding and tracking how they are physically placed on the table. Using a shorthand text description to describe a particular Map Tile may even help an AI be able to track where models are placed within the squares of the tile during a Fight so as to assist in playing the game.  

The Map Tiles that are included in various Core, Adventure, and Expansion boxes are flat cardboard tiles that take on various 2D shapes and have artwork depicted on both sides of the 2D tile. The different art work on either side of a particular Map Tile correspond to two different World Locations (e.g., one side might be a tile for the Mines, while the other depicts a location in the Swampsof Jargono).

The edges of the map tiles are black bordered walls and almost every Map Tile has at least two puzzle-cut spaces for connecting to other randomly drawn Map Tiles. Entrance Map Tiles and End Caps only have a single puzzle-cut connector space. 

The artwork depicted on the tile is from a top-down perspective and highly evocative to help visually represent the Heroes walking through the location when the Hero miniatures are placed on the tile. The artwork is split up into a square grid, about 1" square, to regulate miniature movement across the tile. Each square on the Map Tile is called a space.  

Some of the black bordered walls and edges of the map tile will bleed into some of the edges on the Map Tile, creates spaces that are partially filled with artwork depicting the location and partially depicting the black bordered wall. Spaces with at least 50% of the square covered by artwork is still considered a valid space for models to occupy.  

Spaces occupied by puzzle-cut edges are also considered valid spaces and may be occupied by models wither there is another Map Tile connected or not. Every puzzle-cut connection on ever Map Tile in Shadows of Brimstone is two spaces wide to ensure that all Map Tiles can be connected to one another.  

## Winning and Losing
To Win a Mission, the Heroes must find the Objective and
defeat any Enemies guarding it, as detailed in the particular
Mission being played. For the basic ‘Scouting Party’ Mission,
the Heroes simply need to find the Objective room at the
second Clue Icon and defeat the Enemies there.  

There are two main ways for the Heroes to Fail any
Mission - if all of the Heroes are KO’d or if the Darkness
Escapes.  

### All Heroes KO'd
If all of the Heroes are ever KO’d at the same time,
the Mission immediately ends in failure. The Heroes are
considered to escape, but must all still roll for Injury/Madness.  

### Darkness Escapes
If the Darkness marker ever reaches the Entrance space on
the Depth Track, the Darkness escapes and lays waste to the
countryside. The Mission is failed and the Heroes must head
home in defeat.  

### Running Away
Sometimes things look pretty grim. If all of the Heroes
agree (at least all those that are not yet KO’d), at the start of
any turn, the Hero Party may elect to Flee from the Adventure!
This must be done before anything else in the turn happens.
All of the Heroes (including those that are KO’d) escape and
the Mission is considered to have been failed. Any Heroes that
were KO’d still need to roll for Injury/Madness.  

## Darkness and the Growing Dread
### Darkness Cards
Darkness cards are evil events that can cause Enemies to
leap from the shadows, ceilings to collapse, supernatural events
to occur, or allow the Darkness to steadily grow in power with
cards that Remain in Play. Darkness cards are pretty much
always bad for the Heroes.  

There are two main ways for Darkness cards to be drawn
during the game, whenever the Darkness marker reaches a
Blood Spatter space on the Depth Track, and whenever a
card’s game text instructs the players to do so (this is usually
caused by Scavenge or Encounter cards).  

When a Darkness card is drawn, it is read aloud to all
players, starting with the card title, and then its game effect is
resolved. Once complete, the card is discarded (unless it is
marked as Remains in Play at the bottom of the card).  
### Growing Dread Cards
Growing Dread cards are dark and powerful events that
can spell doom for the Heroes. Unlike Darkness cards, they
are usually not played immediately when drawn. Instead,
whenever a Growing Dread card is drawn, it is placed face
down, without looking at it, in a stack near the Depth Track.
Growing Dread cards are always added to the top of the stack,
and can be fanned out a little so that players can see how many
cards are in the stack. In this way, it creates an impending
feeling of doom over the course of the game as more cards get
added to the stack, with each being potentially deadly!  
### Resolving Growing Dread
When the Objective is found for the current Mission, but
before any Threat cards are drawn or Enemies placed, the
cards in the Growing Dread stack are revealed and resolved,
one at a time, starting from the top of the stack. For the
remainder of this Objective, if any new Growing Dread cards
would be added to the stack, instead resolve them immediately.  
### Canceling Growing Dread
The Heroes are not helpless though. A Growing Dread
card may be canceled if all of the Heroes in the Party collectively
use 1 Grit each (not including Heroes that are KO’d). This
may be done while a Growing Dread card is still face down
(cancel the top card of the stack), or once it has been revealed
(before it takes effect).  

## Health, Sanity and Corruption
There are many ways that a Hero can get hurt while fighting their way through an Adventure (or even just while walking
through the demon-infested wilderness). Every Hero has Health, that measures their ability to take physical damage before
being knocked out, and Sanity, that covers their ability to take mental strain before going mad. It is also possible to be corrupted
by dark influences and even start to mutate from it.  

### Types of Hits
There are 3 types of Hits that a Hero can take - Hits,
Horror Hits, and Corruption Hits.  

- Hits: Hits represent physical damage and cause Wounds if not
prevented.
- Horror Hits: Horror Hits represent mental strain and cause Sanity
Damage if not prevented.
- Corruption Hits: Corruption Hits represent dark influence and cause
Corruption Points if not prevented.

### Defense and Willpower
Each Hero has Defense and Willpower marked on their
character sheets. Both of these are saving rolls that allow the
Hero to try and prevent incoming Hits from doing damage.
Defense is used to prevent Hits while Willpower is used to
prevent both Horror Hits and Corruption Hits.  

Anytime a Hero takes one or more Hits, they may make
a Defense roll against each, needing to roll equal to or higher
than their Defense value to prevent the Hit. For example, if
a Hero has a Defense of 4+ and takes 3 Hits, they would roll
3 Defense dice with each roll of 4, 5, or 6 preventing one of
the incoming Hits. For each Defense roll that failed, the Hero
would take damage from that Hit.  

Willpower works exactly the same way, but is used for
incoming Horror Hits and Corruption Hits instead.  

### Types of Damage
**Wounds**  
Wound markers are placed on a Hero’s
Character Sheet (or Enemy) to show that they
have taken damage against their Health. Each
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Wound unless
stated otherwise.  

**Sanity Damage**  
anity Damage markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to show that they
have taken damage against their Sanity. Each
Horror Hit that is not prevented does 1 Sanity
Damage unless stated otherwise.  

**Corrupton Points**  
Corruption Point markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to track how much
Corruption they have gained. Each Corruption
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Corruption Point.  

### Cover
Sometimes a model will have a special Cover save allowing
them to try and block each incoming Hit they are about to
take. Cover saves work similar to a Defense roll (stopping
an entire Hit when successfully rolled), but are made before
Defense rolls. In addition, a model with a Cover save may still
roll for it, even if the Hit ignores its Defense.  

### Shields
A Shield is an Item that a Hero may carry allowing them
to block some amount of incoming Damage (as listed on the
Item). A Shield must be equipped to be used and usually takes
one of the Hero’s Hand Slots.  

A Shield may be used to prevent Damage
after any Cover and Defense rolls are made, but
must be used before any Armor rolls are made.  

### Amor and Spirit Armor
Armor helps to protect a Hero, even
after their Defense or Willpower has failed
them. Armor protects against Wounds
while Spirit Armor protects against Sanity
Damage. Neither one helps against
Corruption though.  

If a Hero has an Item or ability that
gives them Armor, whenever they are
about to take a number of Wounds (after
Defense rolls and any use of a Shield), roll a D6 for
each individual Wound they are about to take. For each die
roll that is equal to or better than their Armor save, that Wound
is prevented. For example, if a Hero has Armor 5+ and takes two
Hits past their Defense that do 3 Wounds each, the Hero rolls 6 dice.
For every 5 or 6 rolled, one of the incoming Wounds is prevented.  

Spirit Armor works the same way, but allows the Hero to
roll of each point of incoming Sanity Damage instead.  

A Hero may not apply more than one Armor save at a
time (from different Items/abilities), but only uses the best
Armor save they currently have equipped.  

Some Enemies can also have Armor as an ability. This
works just like a Hero’s Armor.  

### Being KO'd
If a Hero ever has Wounds equal to their
Health or Sanity Damage equal to their Sanity,
they are immediately KO’d (Knocked Out),
and no more Wounds/Sanity Damage will be
applied (you cannot fall below 0). Remove
the Hero model from the board and place
a KO’d Hero marker in their space. Other
models may freely move into and through a
space with a KO’d Hero.  

### Recovering
At the end of any turn when there are no Enemies
anywhere on the board, a KO’d Hero may Recover. That
Hero places their model back on the board, removing the
KO’d Hero marker and pushing any model that was in their
space to an adjacent space. They then roll once on the Injury
Chart if their Health was reduced to 0 or the Madness Chart
if their Sanity was reduced to 0. They also get to Heal 2D6
Wounds/Sanity (any mix). This Healing must bring their
Health and Sanity back to at least 1 each.  

If a Hero was reduced to 0 in both Health and Sanity at
the same time, they must roll once on each Chart, but then get
to Heal 2D6 Health and 2D6 Sanity.  

### Revive Tokens
Revive Tokens are a special bonus that
allow the Heroes to overcome otherwise dire
situations. Usually Revive Tokens are held by
the entire Party as a whole rather than by an
individual Hero. Whenever a Hero would be
KO’d, if there are one or more Revive Tokens available, that
Hero may discard a Revive Token to instead be immediately
restored to Full Health and Full Sanity, and Recover 1 Grit.
The Hero does NOT need to roll for Injury or Madness when
using a Revive Token, and ignores any remaining incoming
Hits or Damage from the source that would have KO’d them.  

## Healing

### Healing Health and Sanity
Whenever a Hero is allowed to Heal Health or Sanity
Damage, they simply remove that number of damage markers
from their character. When a Hero is allowed to Fully Heal
Wounds or Sanity Damage, they get to remove all damage
markers of that type from their character.  

### Healing Other Heroes
Any time a Hero Heals Wounds or Sanity Damage from
another Hero (regardless of the method), they gain 5 XP for
each Wound/Sanity healed.  

Tokens like Rum and Bandages may be used to Heal other
Heroes that are adjacent to you during a Fight, or even just on
the same Map Tile while there are no Enemies on the board.  

### Corrupton and Mutation
Fighting nightmarish creatures and working around Dark
Stone can be hazardous, not just to your health and sanity,
but to your soul! As Heroes gain Corruption Points, they
will begin to mutate and change over time. A Hero’s ability to
withstand these effects is called their Corruption Resistance.  

### Corruption Resistance Value
Every Hero starts with a default Corruption Resistance
value of 5. This means that a Hero may only ‘hold’ up to 4
Corruption Points at a time without any ill effect. As soon as
the Hero has 5 Corruption Points (Corruption equal to their
Corruption Resistance value), those Corruption are removed
and the Hero must immediately roll once on the Mutation
chart.  

A Hero’s Corruption Resistance value may be modified by
Items they acquire, events they encounter on their Adventures,
and any number of other things in the game, causing that
Hero to be able to ‘hold’ more or fewer Corruption Points
before they mutate.  

### Rolling For Mutation
To roll on the Mutation chart, a Hero must roll a ‘D36’.
To roll a D36, roll two dice of different colors, where one
of them is the ‘10’s digit and the other is the ‘1’s digit. For
Example, if your rolled 3 and 5 the result on the chart would
be 35.  

### Mutation Death
If a Hero ever rolls a Mutation on the chart that they already
currently have, they have instead mutated beyond recognition
and have become little more than a writhing mass of tentacles
and goo. That Hero is considered to be Dead (though they
may still be Resurrected in Camp between Adventures).  

## A Random Hero
There are many things in the game that require you to
determine a Random Hero. There are two simple ways to do
this - use the Hero Tokens provided to draw one
randomly, or simply roll a die.  
A Hero Token for each Hero in this Set
has been provided and these can be used to
draw from without looking to determine a
Random Hero.  
Alternatively, it is often faster and easier
to simply point to the different Heroes or Players and assign
each a number set, then roll a die to see which is selected.
For instance, if there are 3 Heroes you could say Hero A is
1-2, Hero B is 3-4, and Hero C is 5-6, then roll a D6. Keep
in mind that the D8 also works great for this if there are 4
Heroes (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8).  

## Encounters and Skill Tests
Often times Heroes will come across aspects of the environment or situations that they need to try to overcome or deal with
using their Skills. These are called Encounters and are most often found as part of an Exploration Token while investigating a
room. Encounters can range from a blazing fire to a ghostly apparition, or anything in between.  

### Hero Skills
Every Hero has a set of six Skills that they use to interact
with Encounters, overcome dangerous challenges, and that
define the Hero’s mental and physical prowess.  
A Hero’s Skill values range from 1 to 6. Each of these
values may never be modified to go below 1 or above 6.  

**Agility**  
Used for running, jumping, diving, and rolling, Agility is
tested for challenges that require physical dexterity and stealth.  
**Cunning**  
The ability to understand technology, to outwit opponents,
and to solve puzzles, Cunning is used for challenges that
require the Hero to think their way past a problem.  
**Spirit**  
Used for interacting with the supernatural and the Void,
Spirit determines how good the Hero is at overcoming
demonic and ghostly Encounters as well as mental fortitude.  
**Strength**  
Physical brawn and brute force, Strength determines how
good the Hero is at overpowering things and influences how
far they can throw an item or how much weight they can carry.  
**Lore**  
Knowledge of myth and legend, Lore determines a Hero’s
ability to decipher ancient languages and riddles as well as to
tell stories and interact with occult elements.  
**Luck**  
One cannot underestimate the power of being lucky. Of
course, this has just as much to do with a Hero’s ability to
minimize the effects of bad luck while capitalizing on any
good fortune that comes their way.  

### Encounters
When the Heroes find an Exploration Token that says
Encounter on it, they must draw a card from the Encounter
Deck to see what they have found. Encounters are situations that the Heroes must overcome
to continue on their Mission.
Usually Encounters will have
one or more Skill tests that the
Heroes need to perform.  
Encounters affect all
Heroes, not just those that are
currently in the same room
(though some Encounters
are listed specifically as only
affecting Heroes that are on
the Map Tile). Heroes that are
currently in another World
do NOT participate.  
### Who Takes the Test
Skill tests on an Encounter are
marked with an icon to show who must take the test.  
- {One Hero} One Hero: One Hero is chosen to make the
Skill test. The Heroes must decide amongst
themselves who will take it.
- {All Heroes} All Heroes: Every Hero must make the Skill test.
- {One Random} One Random: One Hero, chosen randomly,
must make the Skill test.

### Making a Skill Test
To make a Skill test, the Hero rolls a number of dice
equal to their value in that Skill. As long as any one of those
dice is equal to or greater than the target number, the test is
successfully passed.  
For example, if a Hero needs to make a Lore 5+ test, they roll
a number of dice equal to their Lore Skill. As long as one of those
dice rolls a 5 or higher, the test is passed. If not, the test is failed.  

### Skill Tests Outside of an Encounter
Sometimes Heroes will be called on to make a Skill test
outside of an Encounter. This most often occurs because of
special Enemy abilities or between Adventures while in Camp.
These Skill tests work the same way, and it should be clear by
the Event or card text who needs to make the test (usually the
Hero that rolled the Event).  

### Multiple Encounters
Sometimes an Exploration Token will call for multiple
Encounters (For Example - Encounters x2). When this occurs,
draw all of the needed Encounters and resolve them in any
order you like. The only important thing to note is that any
Enemies that Attack as a result of an Encounter will not be
placed or start the Fight until all of the other non-Enemy
aspects of the Encounters have been completed (so all Skill
tests, etc. must be taken before Enemies are placed on the
board). This can result in multiple Enemy Attacks at once.  


## XP and Gold
XP and Gold are only needed when keeping Heroes
from one Adventure to the next, and are gathered in large
quantities, so no counters are included for them. Instead, it is
recommended that players track their XP and Gold by keeping
a running total of each on a piece of paper.  

## Cards
There are many different decks of cards in the game that
are used for everything from dynamically generating the board
as you explore it, to the Enemies you encounter, to the cool
Gear and Artifacts you find along the way.  

**Keywords**  
Most cards have Keywords associated with them, listed
just below the title of the card. The Keywords usually do not
have any inherent meaning, but are occasionally referenced by
other cards and rules.  

**Icons**  
Many cards contain icons that represent various aspects
of the card. A full list of these icons can be found on the
Reference Summary at the back of this Rulebook.  

**Remains in Play**  
Some cards are listed as Remains in Play. As it sounds,
these cards stay in play and continue to affect the game until
the end of the Adventure, or they are canceled in some way.  

**Discard Piles**  
For each deck of cards in the game there will also be a
discard pile. The discard pile should be formed face up next to
the deck and is where cards from that deck go when they have
been used and are no longer in play. Any player may look
through any discard pile at any time. If any deck ever runs
out of cards, shuffle the discard pile thoroughly and reform the
deck face down.  

Some of the card decks (such as Loot and Scavenge cards)
do not have discard piles, but rather are fully shuffled every
time one or more cards need to be drawn.  

## Card Types

### Gear and Artifact Cards
Gear and Artifact cards represent different items and pieces of equipment that a Hero can collect and use to help them on
their adventures. Gear are more common items that can be found and are often a bit more disposable. Artifacts are more rare
and powerful items that usually have occult or magical origins, or come from another world altogether.  

### Items
There are a few limiting factors that restrict how many
Items that a Hero may carry and use at any given time.  
**Hands**  
Each Hero has 2 Hand slots that they can assign Items
to each turn. This can be up to two different Single-Handed
Items or one Double-Handed Item.  
- {Single Handed} Single Handed: This Item requires one of the Hero's two Hand slots to have equipped during the turn.
- {Double Handed} Double Handed: This Item requires both of the Hero’s Hand slots
to have equipped during the turn.

At the start of a Hero’s Activation each turn, the Hero
may decide what Items they want to assign to their two Hand
slots. Any of the Hero’s other unassigned Items that require
one or two Hands to use, do not give the Hero any benefit
from their card text.  
Note that assigning Items to your Hand slots ‘at the start
of your Activation’ is usually only important during a Fight
and it is assumed that the Hero can swap different Items into
and out of their Hands when there are no Enemies on the
board. You may still only ever use two Hand slots at any given
time though.  

**Weight and Caryying Limit**  
Many Items have one or more small Weight
icons {Anvil} on them to show that they are limited.  
Hero may only carry 5 + their Strength
in Weight icons {Anvil} at any time.  

**Keyword Restrictions**  
Some Items have a red restriction bar that requires a Hero
to have a certain Keyword to be able to use the Item. For
example, if an Item says Strange Only, the Hero must have
the Keyword Strange to use the Item.  

**Clothing Items**  
Occasionally an Item will have the
Keyword Clothing followed by one
or more other Keywords that tell the
Clothing Slot that the Item fills (Torso,
Shoulders, Gloves, Coat, etc). These
Items can be very powerful, but a Hero
is limited to only a single Clothing
Item for each unique Clothing Slot. So
a Hero may only have one Clothing
- Gloves equipped at any given time,
as well as one Clothing - Coat and
one Clothing - Hat, etc.  

**Items with Limited Use**  
Some Items are limited in how often they can be used.
These Items are marked as ‘Once Per Turn’, ‘Once Per Fight’,
‘Once Per Adventure’, etc. When a Limited Use Item like this
is used, rotate the card or flip the card over to Exhaust it
(show that it has been used). You may Ready that card (unrotate
or flip it back over to show that it may be used again)
when the time frame of its limitation is complete.  
So for instance, a ‘Once Per Turn’ Item should be
Exhausted when used, and then be Readied at the end of the
current Turn, while a ‘Once Per Fight’ Item would be Readied
at the end of the current Fight.  
This terminology is also used for some Abilities.  

### Personal Items
Personal Items are very powerful and characterful cards
that are unique. Every new Hero character gets to draw
one Personal Item to give them a special bonus as well as
to thematically help fill in the backstory of the character. If
a Duelist gets the War Veteran’s Dagger, perhaps she has seen
death up close during the wars in Europe! Or perhaps she
took it as a trophy from the first opponent she ever defeated
in a duel.  
Personal Items may never be traded, lost, sold, or
discarded in any way. They help to define who the Hero is
and the Hero will carry it till the day they die.  

### Dark Stone Icons
{Dark Stone} Some Items have a Dark Stone Icon on them,
usually in the upper left corner. This means that
the Item is charged with Dark Stone energy in
some way and counts as one Dark Stone when
considering how much Dark Stone a Hero is carrying.  

### Item Upgrades
Many Items have the capacity to be upgraded to give
them extra benefits or abilities. These Items have one or more
Upgrade Slots on them, shown at the bottom left of the card.  

**Upgrade Slots**  
{Upgrade Slot}  
{Upgrade Required Slot}  
Items often have up to 3 Upgrade Slots
on it, with each Slot represented as an empty
circle. Upgrade Slots can be filled with an
Upgrade Item or with a Forged Dark Stone Upgrade added
to the Item by a blacksmith in Camp. These Upgrades will
have one or more Slot Requirements (filled in black circles)
to show how many Upgrade Slots they occupy
when attached to an Item.  

**Attaching an Upgrade**  
As noted above, Upgrades come in two forms, either as
a card that the Hero finds during an Adventure, or as Dark
Stone that is forged directly onto the Item in Town.  
An Upgrade card lists on it what it can be attached to as
well as if it takes any resources to attach it to an Item (usually
Dark Stone).  
When an Upgrade card is
attached to an Item, it fills in a
number of Upgrade Slots equal to
its Slot Requirement and gives that
Item the listed Bonus.  
Upgrade cards attached to an
Item can be removed at any time
so that they can be attached to
a different Item, sold, etc. The
resources used to attach the
Upgrade originally are lost.  
Dark Stone that is Forged
directly onto an Item
is a permanent change and may
not be removed. It is now part
of the Item.  

### Side Bag
Each Hero has a Side
Bag that is used to carry
helpful Side Bag Tokens
like Rum, Bandages,
Bomb, Tonic, etc. A Side
Bag may hold up to 5
Tokens on it at a time
and these can be any
mixture of different Side
Bag Tokens.  

**Side Bag Tokens**  
Side Bag Tokens are generally small ‘discard to
use’ objects that a Hero may have more than one of. A Side
Bag Token can be identified by its parchment background and
green title bar for the name of the Token.  
Generally, Side Bag Tokens may be used at any time
(unless used as an Attack/Free Attack, which must be during
your Activation).  
A complete reference of all Side Bag Tokens is found later in this reference.  
## Creating A New Hero
Creating a new Hero is fast and easy. It is often just as fun
to start a fresh new Hero as it is to keep one Hero from game
to game, over a series of Adventures. To create a new Hero,
just follow these simple steps:  

### Choose Hero Class (and Sub-Class)
The most important choice for a new Hero is what
Hero Class you want to play, and for a Team Hero like the
Conquistadors, Vikings, or Trederran Strike Team, what Sub-Class you want to play.  
Each Hero Class/Sub-Class has its own unique stats and Abilities,
and a fairly different play style.  
Most standard Hero Classes have no Sub-Class. But Adventure Sets use Team Heroes. In the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set, 
the Heroes are the Conquistador Hero Class, but there are 4
different Sub-Classes of Conquistador to choose from - El
Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier.  

### Get Starting Items
Every Hero Class/Sub-Class has a small list of Starting
Items printed on their Character Sheet that they get for free.
Find these Items for your Hero amongst the Starting Gear
cards. It is important to note that, in many ways, the Starting
Gear of a Hero is just as important a factor as their Abilities
and stats. Note that Heroes may NOT trade or give their
Starting Items to other Heroes.  

### Draw a Personal Item
Every Hero starts their adventuring career with one
Personal Item that not only gives them a powerful bonus,
but can help to define the backstory of that Hero. Draw one
Personal Item card for your Hero.  
Some Hero Classes draw from special themed decks of Personal Item Cards. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not specify a specific deck to draw your Personal Item card from, use the standard deck.

### Choose Your Starting Upgrade
When creating a brand new Hero you get to choose one of
the Hero Starting Upgrades available to your Hero Class. Each
Sub-Class of Conquistador has 2 unique Starting Upgrades
to choose from that help to define your Hero right from the
beginning. Choose wisely though as the Upgrade you don’t
pick will not be available later.  

### Get a Side Bag and Free Token
Take a Side Bag
marker for your Hero.
Every Hero has a Side
Bag that can hold up
to 5 Tokens in it. A
New Hero also gets
to choose one Side Bag
Token to start with for free.
Choose from Rum, Bandages, Tonic,
or Bomb.  

As new Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been released over the years, Heroes that were included in different sets are inteded to pick from a different pool of Side Bag Tokens for their free starting token. Heroes native to different settings and sets should pick from the starting tokens provided in the following table:  

- **Old West Heroes:**
(City of Ancients Core Set, Swamps of Death Core Set, The Impossible Hell Train Core Set, Various Hero Packs)  
  - Bandage
  - Whiskey
  - Tonic 
  - Dynamite

- **Feudal Japanese Heroes:**
(Forbidden Fortress Core Set, Various Hero Packs)
  - Bandage
  - Sake
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Spanish Fort Heroes:**
(Valley of the Serpent King Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - Rum
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Viking Heroes:**
(Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - ?
  - Tonic
  - ?

- **Trederran Team Heroes:**
(Trederran Strike Team Expansion)
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?

Some specific Heroes, such as a the Jargono Native, may have special rules which allow that Hero to start with a different Side Bag token. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not have specify any special tokens, use the previous tables to pick according to the native setting of your Hero's Class/Sub-Class.  

### Name Your Hero
Lastly, you should choose a
fitting name for your Hero. And pick
something good, you never know if that
name will be spoken of as legend in the
royal courts throughout Spain and the world
at large!  

## Adventure Set Up
An Adventure is generally a single play-session where the Heroes try to successfully complete a Mission. While players can choose to play a Campaign, keeping their Heroes across many Adventures and play-sessions, Shadows of Brimstone can also be played as just a single Adventure if players choose.  

To Set Up for an Adventure, complete the following steps in the order listed.  

### Number of Players/Heroes
Decide on the number of Heroes that will be taking part
in the Adventure. Usually this is one Hero per player, but
sometimes it is fun to play a game controlling two or more
Heroes each, for a fewer number of players.  

### Shuffle Card Decks
Thoroughly shuffle all of the required card decks and place them on the table. Most Adventures require the following decks of cards:  
- Darkness
- Growing Dread
- Loot
- Scavenge
- Low, Med, High, and Epic Threats
- Gear
- Artifacts
- Encounters
- Map Cards
- World Card

If playing an Adventure in an OtherWorld, you will need the Threat, Encounters, Map Cards, and Artifacts corresponding to that OtherWorld.  

Note that players may freely mix cards and other content across multiple Core Sets, Adventure Sets, and other expansions as they desire. For example, if playing an Adventure in the Forbidden Fortress as Fedual Japanese Heroes, the players may wish to only include Darkness, Growing Dread, Gear, and Threat cards intended for the Forbidden Fortress setting. Or, they may wish to include cards from any other content as desired!

For Loot and Scavenge decks, players are free to combine cards across multiple Core and Adventure Sets, but doing so is not recommended. The distribution of cards in these two decks provide a mix of good, neutral, and bad effects as intended by the designers.  

Don't forget to place an appropriate World Card face up on the table that matches the World in which your Adventure is taking place, as it may add special gameplay effects as depicted on the card.  

During your Adventures, you
may pass through Gates that allow you to visit strange
alien OtherWorlds. These Worlds each have their own World
card. Some Missions actually begin in an OtherWorld, as
listed in the Mission Set Up.  

### Prepare Exploration Tokens
Shuffle up all 8 Exploration Tokens and create a stack of
them face down that players can draw from when they find a
new room.  

Mixing Exploration Tokens from multiple Core and Adventure Sets is not recommended.

### Ready Heroes
Prepare each Hero that will be taking part. If these are
new Heroes, make sure each of them is ready to go using the
steps of Creating a New Hero.  

One Hero gets the Old Lantern card as the Light Source,
in addition to their other Gear. The players may choose who
will take it at the start of each Adventure.  

Draw Team Ability cards and add them to the pool if any players are using Team Heroes. 

Ensure each Hero has any necessary starting markers, tokens, etc., such as Grit, Ability Tokens (Ambition, Fury, Mana, etc.), free Side Bag Token, etc. 

### Select Mission
Select a Mission to play. For your first time learning the game, this should
be the first Basic Mission included in the Core Set or Adventure Set you are playing with.  

Players may use whatever methods the like to select a Mission. They may pick one by choice, select one randomly, or use whatever methodology they like.  

Note that some Missions have special Set Up instructions.  

### Prepare Depth Track
Place the Depth Track where all players can see it, and
position the Darkness marker on the Darkness Start space and
the Hero Party marker on the Entrance space. Note that some Missions may have special instructions which may modify these rules.  

### Place Entrance Map Tile
Set the Entrance Map Tile in the center of the table,
where all players can reach it.  

### Place Heroes
Lastly, each Hero model is placed on the Entrance Map
Tile in one of the 8 Starting Area spaces.  

The Starting Area on the Entrance Map Tile includes all
8 spaces in the back two rows. The
Heroes can be positioned in any of these eight spaces, and
should be placed on the board in Initiative order, from highest
to lowest.  

## Number of Heroes
The number of Heroes taking part in an Adventure
determines the difficulty and quantity of Enemies you will
be facing. This is scaled in two ways - with Low, Med,
and High Threat Decks for Enemies as well as with Revive
Tokens to help fewer Heroes survive a little longer.  

| Heroes | Scaling |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | Low Threats, 2 Revive Tokens |
| 2      | Low Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 3      | Med Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 4      | Med Threats |
| 5      | High Treats, 1 Revive Token |
| 6      | High Treats |

## Enemies
Every Enemy Type is represented by a large Enemy Record Sheet that lists its stats and abilities. The Record Sheets are
double-sided and have the normal (green) stats on one side, and the Brutal (red) stats on the other. The Brutal Enemy side is
generally only used for groups of Heroes that are quite experienced and have been through many Adventures.  

### Enemy Type
This tells the name of the specific Enemy Type, such as
Tentacles, Temple Guard, or Drowned Dead.  

### Keyword
All Enemies have one or more Keywords that define the
category they fall into (Demon, Myth, Void, etc). Generally
these Keywords don’t have any built-in meaning, but are often
referenced by other cards or abilities.  

### Size
The Size of the Enemy - Small, Medium, Large, Extra
Large, or even XXL.  

### Initiative
Just like Heroes, every Enemy has an Initiative that tells
when they get to Activate in the turn order.  

### Abilities
Most Enemies have one or more Special Abilities that
affect how they fight the Heroes.  

### Move
This is the number of spaces that the Enemy can move
during their Activation. Unlike Heroes, Enemies have a fixed
move which makes them predictable and easier to move in
large groups.  

### Escape
When a Hero is adjacent to the Enemy and wants to move
away, they must first pass an Escape test using this Escape
value (more on this a bit later).  

### 'To Hit' Values
Just like Heroes, Enemies have a To Hit value for Ranged
Attacks and Melee Attacks.  

### Combat
The number of Combat dice the Enemy gets to roll against
a Hero when making a Melee Attack.  

### Damage
The amount of Damage a Hero takes for each Enemy
Combat Hit they fail to block with their Defense.  

### Defense
Unlike a Hero’s Defense (which is a roll to block
Damage), an Enemy’s Defense is a fixed amount of Damage
that is prevented from each Hit the Enemy would take.  

### Health
The number of Wounds that it takes to kill the Enemy.  

### XP Value
Every Enemy is worth XP to the Hero that kills it.
Many larger or tougher Enemies give XP to a Hero just for
Wounding it.  

### Elite Chart
Every Enemy Type has an Elite Chart of six extra Abilities
that make it harder to defeat or more deadly in a Fight. When
a group of Enemies is Elite, they get to roll on the Chart to
see what extra Ability or Abilities that group of Enemies has.  

### Brutal Side
Brutal Enemy Side
The back side of each Enemy Record Sheet has the Brutal
version of that Enemy Type, displayed with a red background.
These Brutal Enemies are generally only encountered by higher
level Heroes that have played many Adventures. This is a way
of scaling the Enemies that the Heroes have to fight over the
course of a campaign.  

## Fights
When the Heroes come across a group of Enemies, their exploration of the area takes a back seat to fighting for their lives.
These engagements are called Fights and cover the time from when Enemies appear until the last Enemy is defeated and the
Fight is over. Fights make up the bulk of the action in the game and are an exciting way for the Heroes to get XP and Loot,
though they can also be quite dangerous.  

### Attack!
The most common way for a Fight to
begin is by finding an Attack Exploration
Token while Exploring a Room. When
an Attack occurs, the Heroes must draw a
Threat card to see what has attacked them.
Attacks can also be caused by other things
as well, such as Darkness cards, Encounters, a
Depth Event, etc.  

### Drawing Threat Cards
When a Fight begins,
the first thing that the
players need to do is find
out what Enemies are
actually attacking them.
Usually, this means drawing
a Threat card (though
sometimes the Attack will
call for a specific Type of
Enemy as listed on the card
or Event that caused the
Attack in the first place).  
To draw a Threat card,
you simply take the top card
from the Threat Deck of the
appropriate Threat Level. This
is based on the number of Heroes in the Party.
1-2 Heroes use the Low Threats (green), 3-4 Heroes use the
Med Threats (yellow), and 5-6 Heroes use the High Threats
(red).  

### Attacks by Specific Enemies
When a card or event calls for an Attack by a specific
Enemy Type, there is no need to draw a Threat card. Instead,
the Type and number of Enemies is pre-set and listed in the
text for that card/event.  

### Number of Enemy Models
Sometimes the number of Enemy
models that will be taking part in the Fight
is simply listed on the card. Many times,
however, it will be a variable number of
Enemies that the players must roll for, using
a D6, D3, or the Peril Die {P}.  
The Peril Die is a special 6-sided die that has
faces marked 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, and 6. This allows for a
variable number of Enemies to show up, but never
less than 3 at a time.  
The Peril die is represented on cards and text as
the symbol: {P}  
Sometimes multiple Peril Dice will be used to find
the number of Enemies for an Enemy Type that favors
larger groups. For instance, Tentacles often show up with
up to 12 Enemies at a time, and will frequently be listed
on a Threat card as:  
{P}{P} Tentacles  
In these cases, the Peril Die should be rolled twice and the
two numbers added together to find the total.  

### Placing Enemies on the Board
Once you have determined what Types of Enemies are
taking part in the Fight, and how many there are of each
Type, it is time to place them on the board. Enemies from an
Attack Exploration Token are placed on the Map Tile where
the Token was revealed.  
Enemies are placed on the board in reverse
order of Initiative, from lowest to highest. So
the slowest Enemies are always at the back of
the group.  
Starting with the lowest Initiative Enemy Type, models
are placed on the Map Tile in every other space, forming a
checkerboard pattern starting in the row farthest from the Map
Tile Entrance, all the way to the back left (as shown in the
diagram below). This includes any puzzle connection halfspaces.  
Once all of an Enemy Type has been placed, continue
on to the next lowest Initiative Enemy Type, until all Enemies
have been placed on the board. If more than one Enemy
Type shares the same Initiative, roll randomly between them
for which is placed first.  
Skip over any spaces that are not valid map spaces (less
than 50% of a space) as well as any spaces that already have
a model in it.  

### Placing Enemy Example
Since this is a text only example with no visual diagrams, let's imagine a Map Tile on the table with each space number and display as below as columns and rows:  
```
      |01|02|  
      |03|04|05|06|  
|07|08|09|10|11|12|  
|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|  
   |20|21|22|23|24|25|  
         |26|27|  
         |28|29|  
```
The Map Tile entrance spaces in the above map would be spaces 28 and 29. 
If you had to play 2 Temple Guard (Initiative 3) and 6 Serpentmen Archers (Initiative 6), the Temple Guard would be placed first, starting on the opposide side of the Map Tile entrance spaces. Once all Enemy models were placed they would be located as follows:
- Temple Guard: 01, 04
- Serpentmen Archers: 06, 07, 09, 11, 14, 16

If there are more Enemy models to place than will fit in
the checkerboard pattern on the Map Tile, return to the back
row and begin placing models to fill in the spaces between.  
If there are more models than will fit on the Map Tile,
even with every space filled (which is rather rare), overflow
models should be placed onto the Map Tile connected to
the Entrance of the Room (most likely filling in around the
Heroes) until they have all been placed.

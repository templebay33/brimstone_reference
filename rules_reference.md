# Shadows of Brimstone - Rules Compilation

This is a text reference of rules compilation for Shadows of Brimstone. The core game rules across all Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been merged into a single reference that is not specific to any particular Core Set or Adventure Set. Additional rules across expansions is also included. The only rules not included in this reference are text on various game cards, charts, Missions, Hero Sheets, and Enemy Reference Sheets. These references can be found in separate documents.  

Note that many of the official game rules in PDF and printed format include visual elements such as icons, thematic artwork, graphic design elements, and diagrams that are not included in this text-only version of the rules.  

This text-only version of the rules is intended to be easily referenced by AI models as training data and reference information for context. As a result, the formatting may be more flat and simple, but less visually readable for humans.  

Since many AI models cannot currently work with other data types than text (such as images, video, and audio), important image data for explaining the rules are given text keywords with text-based descriptions. These visual elements, such as icons, tokens, markers, and diagrams, are summarized with a keyword or letter in curly braces {} throughout the rules. As a short-hand, text descriptions of each symbol and other visual element is provided for AI models in the list below:  

- {P}: Peril Die Icon. This depicts a yellow 6-sided die. The Peril Die is larger and physically distinct from the other D6 dice that come with the game, and has embossed number values with a worn, frayed background etched into the die. The Peril Die does not use standard 1-6 values, but instead has the following values on its 6 faces: 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. Whenever the game official game rules display a visual icon of the Peril Die, this reference will use {P} instead.
- {C}: Clue Icon. Clue icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens. Visually the look like a small red circle with a white exclamation mark in the center and a bit of drop shadow around the circle. Clue icons can have a somewhat abstract meaning depending on the context of the mission being played. Most missions will assign some special meaning to Clue Icons found on Exploration Tokens during a Mission.
- {Gate}: Gate Icon. Gate icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate that there is a gate instead of a door connected to the currently explored Map Tile which leads to an OtherWorld. The gate icon itself looks like a circular swirl of blue light.  
- {Door}: Door icon. Door icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens and indicate the number of doorways on the currently explored Map Tile are open and lead to more Map Tiles. All other puzzle-cut edges of a Map Tile are closed with an End Cap tile if they do not depict either a Door or a Gate.
- {One Hero}: One Hero icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a skill test to indicate that a single Hero chosen by the players must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with the white silhouette of a person in the center.
- {All Heroes}: All Heroes icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that all Heroes must take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with one white silhouette of a person in the center and two additional grey silhouettes on either side of the white one.
- {One Random}: One Random icon. Usually found on Encounter Cards that require a Skill Test to indicate that a Hero must be chosen at random to take the Skill Test. The visual icon is a black circle with a white question mark on the left and a white silhouette of a person on the right.
- {One Handed}: One Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires one hand available to be equipped. It looks like a square icon of a worn slab of wood with a black hand icon in the center foreground.
- {Double Handed}: Double Handed icon. Indicates that an item requires both hands to be available to be equipped. It looks like a rectangular icon of a worn slab of wood with two black hand icons in the foreground, side by side.
- {Anvil}: Weight icon. Indicates units of weight of a particular item if carried by a Hero. The icon is transparent and has no background, but it in the simple shape of a black anvil as seen from a side perspective.
- {Dark Stone}: Dark Stone icon. Often indicates that an Item is charged with Dark Stone energy and will require a Hero carrying the item to occasionally take Corruption Hits. It looks like a round circular icon with a dark purple background and a white chunk of crystal in the center foreground.
- {Upgrade Slot}: Upgrade Slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is able to be upgraded and has upgrade capacity equal to the number of slots depicted on the icon. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots depicted. The icon looks like a horizontal series of circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series.
- {Upgrade Required Slot}: Upgrade required slot. Indicates that the item it is found on is itself an upgrade, and will occupy a number of Upgrade Slots depicted by the icon when attached to an item. When describing this icon throughout the text, it will be followed by a number (usually x1-x3) to indicate the number of upgrade slots required. The icon looks like a horizontal series of filled in circles with a bit of stylized filigree on the left and right edges of the series of circles. 

## Game Overview
Shadows of Brimstone is a fast-paced, Cooperative, dungeon-crawl boardgame with set in a variety of fantastic worlds. Each player creates a character. Forming a party of Heroes, the players take their characters on great adventures.  

Missions are designed for maximum replayability as everything you encounter, including the board layout, is dynamically generated as the story unfolds. Explore the various worlds and locations, overcoming dangerous encounters and fighting ruthless creatures, while collecting useful Gear and ancient Artifacts to aid in your adventures. Heroes can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their expedition on the other side.  

With a robust campaign system, Hero characters can be kept from game to game, earning experience and going up in levels to increase their skills and gain new abilities. The Heroes can also visit Towns, and sometimes Cities and Expedition Camps, spending their hard earned money on goods and services.  

So unfurl the sails, take up your sword, and strap on your armor, the Darkness closes in, adventure awaits!  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. If combining a Core Set or Adventure Set with another Core Set or additional Hero Packs, this can be increased to 5-6 players. All of the players work together against the game itself and the difficulty is scaled based on the number of Heroes taking part in each adventure.

## Dice
The game comes with 16 standard six-sided dice (8 White and 8 Red) that should be divided amongst the players. There are two colors of dice included, as often players will want to roll a group of dice together with some of them being special (ex. - “the Red dice are for Critical Hits”). Often cards will refer to the terms D6 and D3. D6 is just another name for a six-sided die. D3 means to roll a six-sided die using the following results:  

- 1-2 = 1
- 3-4 = 2
- 5-6 = 3

### Re-rolls
There are many things in the game that let you Re-roll one or more dice. It is important to note though that:  
**You may not Re-roll the same die more than once.**  

### 8-Sided Die
The game also comes with an 8-sided die which is used for some special rolls. This die is often referred to as a D8.  

### Peril Die {P}
There is also a larger, special six-sided die included called the Peril Die. This die is marked with the numbers 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. It is most often used for determining the quantity of Enemies during an attack, and is represented on cards as a {P} symbol.  

## Wounds and Sanity Damage
Red Wound Markers are placed on Heroes and Enemies to keep track of how much damage they have taken during the game, while blue Sanity markers are placed on Heroes to show how much Sanity Damage they have taken. There are individual Wound/Sanity Markers as well as larger markers representing 5 Wounds/Sanity each.  

## Ability Tokens
The term Ability Token is used to refer to
any of the various special tokens used by Hero
Classes to trigger their unique abilities.  

## Ambition Tokens
Conquistador Heroes use a special Ability Token called Ambition. Similar to Grit, it allows them a Re-roll, but for just a single die, with a powerful bonus.  

## Dark Stone
These markers are used to keep track of Dark Stone shards that Heroes find on their adventures.  

## Grit
Grit is a resource that Heroes have that can be used for Re-rolling dice, activating special abilities, or adding a burst of speed to your movement. 

Grit is a resource that represents a Hero’s
ability to tough out difficult situations and pull
off amazing feats; dodging a fatal blow at the
last minute, scoring a particularly difficult hit,
or activating a powerful special ability to save
the day. In short, it allows Heroes to be heroic!
Every Hero has Grit (they wouldn’t be much of
a Hero without it).  

### Using Grit
A Hero may use a Grit to do one of three things:
- Use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of dice that your
Hero just rolled.
- Use 1 Grit to add an extra D6 to your Hero’s
Movement.
- Use Grit to activate a Special Ability or Item that
requires it.


### Re-roll Limits
Grit can be very useful for Re-rolling dice when you need
to, but it is important to remember that no single die may ever
be Re-rolled more than once. So, for example, you CANNOT
Re-roll all of your misses with a Grit, and then use an ability or
spend another Grit to Re-roll the ones that still missed.
Grit may only be used to Re-roll dice that have been
rolled for your Hero (not other Heroes, Enemies, etc).
In Addition, Grit may not be used on any roll on a Chart
or the roll to Hold Back the Darkness (more on that later).  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is a very powerful resource, but is limited. Each
Hero starts every Mission with 1 Grit, but more can be gained
throughout the Adventure. The most common way to Recover
a Grit is by rolling a 1 for your Move roll. This is covered in
greater detail later in the section on Hero Activation.  

### Max Grit
Every Hero Class has a Max Grit listed on their Character
Sheet. This is generally Max Grit 2 for most new Heroes.
Max Grit is simply the most Grit your Hero can have at one
time.  

If you are already at your Max Grit and you would get to
Recover a Grit, though you can’t hold onto it, you are allowed
to immediately spend that new Grit instead of just losing it.
This is most often used to activate an ability that costs Grit or
to gain the extra D6 to your Move for the turn.  

## Corruption
During the game, Heroes can gain Corruption Points, slowly pushing them down the path of evil and mutation.  

## Exploration Tokens
These markers are placed face down in new rooms discovered as the Heroes explore and, when revealed, tell the number of exits a room has as well as if there are any Encounters or Enemies to be overcome there. Some also have a {C} Clue Icon.  

## Side Bags and Side Bag Tokens
Each Hero has a Side Bag that can carry helpful Tokens for them such as Bandages, Rum, or Bombs.  

## Deuling Tactics
An assortment of Dueling Tactics markers are
included to represent the different tactics that Heroes
can practice in Camp to unleash on their foes in
battle.  

## Scavenged Markers
These markers are used to show when a
Map Tile has been successfully Scavenged by the
Heroes for anything of value.  

## Revive Tokens
These tokens are occasionally used to give
Heroes an extra chance at survival, allowing a
Hero that was just KO’d to get back up
without long-lasting effects.  

## Creeping Shadows
Creeping Shadows are a type of Enemy, that
emerges from the darkness to swarm the Heroes
and attack them from within their space.  

## Hero and KO'd Hero Markers
Hero markers can be used for determining a Random
Hero from the group. KO’d Hero markers are placed in the
space where a Hero was KO’d.  

## Hero Characters
Each player must choose what type of Hero they want to play. These different Hero ‘types’ are called Classes. In some
Adventure Sets, all of the Heroes included are from a single Hero Class - (Conquistador, Viking, etc.). However, the Hero
Class is a ‘Team Hero’ Class meaning that it is a group of Heroes that all share a common background and basic abilities, but
are further defined by having several different Sub-Classes (El Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier). Each of these Sub-Classes
is still considered a Conquistador Hero, but has a unique Character Sheet with all of its basic Skills, Abilities, and Starting Gear
listed on it. Below is a list of the different elements of
a Hero Character Sheet:

### Hero Class and Sub-Class
A character’s Hero Class is the main thematic defining
factor for their Skills and Abilities. The Sub-Class for a Team
Hero further defines the theme that sets them apart from other
Heroes of that Class.  

### Keywords
A Hero’s Keywords are traits of that character. They do
not have any inherent meaning, but are referenced by other
cards and Abilities (often as restrictions for certain Items).  

### 'To Hit' Values
What the Hero needs to roll on their dice to hit Enemies
when making an Attack. There are two different To Hit values,
one for Ranged Attacks and one for Melee Attacks.  

### Combat
The base number of dice that the Hero gets to roll when
making a Melee Attack, even if they have no weapons.  

### Max Grit
The max number of Grit the Hero can have at one time.  

### Skill Attributes
There are 6 different Skills that every Hero has, Agility,
Cunning, Spirit, Strength, Lore, and Luck. These Skills are
used for making tests during the game.  

### Initiative
Initiative determines how quick a character is and how
early in the turn they get to Activate. Each turn models are
Activated in Initiative order, from highest to lowest.  

### Abilities
Every Hero Class has one or more special Abilities that
are an important part of being that Hero Class. These Abilities
are not always beneficial, but fundamentally effect how the
Hero plays.  

### Starting Items
Gear that any character of that Hero Class/Sub-Class starts
their adventuring career with.  

### Health
A representation of the Hero’s physical well being. Health
is reduced by taking Wounds. If your Health is ever reduced
to 0, you are KO’d.  

### Defense
Any time the Hero takes one or more Hits, they may
use their Defense as a saving roll against each Hit to prevent
taking Wounds.  

### Sanity
Sanity is just like Health, but for the Hero’s mental well
being. Sanity is reduced by taking Sanity Damage. Just like
Health, if your Sanity ever reaches 0, you are KO’d.  

### Willpower
Just like Defense is to Health, Willpower is a saving roll
for Sanity to prevent taking Sanity Damage or Corruption.  


## Depth Track
The Depth Track represents the general path of the Heroes and tracks how deep the Hero Party has journeyed into the wild, and how close the Darkness is to escaping and wreaking havoc on the countryside (resulting in failure for the Heroes). At the start of the game, the Hero Party marker is placed at the Entrance space on the far left of the track, while the Darkness marker is placed on the Darkness Start space on the far right.  

During the course of the game, the Hero Party marker moves down the track every time a new Map Tile is placed, as the Heroes travel deeper and deeper into the dark. The Darkness marker moves the opposite direction, up the track, as the Heroes fail to hold the Darkness at bay.  

### Visual Description of the Depth Track
The Depth Track is a flat, rectangular cardboard component about 7cm high and 22.5cm wide. Each Core Set and Adventure Set includes a cardboard Depth Track in the box, visually themed with graphic design elements to match the setting of the Core/Adventure box. Deluxe Depth track expansions are also available made out of Resin or Plastic that are 3D and intended to be painted. No matter which Depth Track is in use thematically, the spaces and mechanics are all the same no matter which one is being used. The visual style and build material of the component is purely aesthetic.  

The Depth track consists of spaces spread out horizontally across the width (22.5cm) of the track. Each "space" is a colored circle with a designated number in the center. The circular spaces are vertically staggered in an alternating pattern, such that next space to the left or right of the current space is at a diagonal angle.  

The first space on the left edge of the Depth Track is not numbered, and is labled the Entrance Space. The last space on the right edge of the Depth Track is also not numbered and is labled the Darkness Start space. All other circular space between the Entrance and Darkness Start spaces are numbered. The numbers start at 15 on the left side of the track (15 is the first space to the right of the Entrance space), and descend to space 1 on the right side of the track (the first space to the left of the Darkness Start space is the 1 space).  In this way, the numbers from left to right descend from 15 to 1.  

Spaces 15, 11, and 6 are additionally marked as Growing Dread spaces. This indicates that when the Darkness Marker reaches these spaces, a random Growing Dread card is added face-down to the Growing Dread Stack without the players looking.  

Spaces 13, 10, 8, 4, and 2 have an artistic border around the circumference of the circular space that looks like a blood spatter. These spaces are referred to as "Blood Spatter" spaces on the Depth Track and indicate that a random Darkness Card is drawn and resolved whenever the Darkness Marker lands on a Blood Spatter space.  

There are two verital lines that separate the Darkness Track into 3 stages. The first vertical line is between spaces 11 and 10, the second is between spaces 6 and 5. This separates the Depth Track into three stages. Each secton has a number at the bottom of the track. These numbers from the left side to the right side of the track are: 7+, 8+, and 9+. These numbers indicate the value that the player holding the Light Source must meet or exceed on a 2d6 roll when Holding Back the Darkness, depending on which of the 3 stages the Hero Party Marker is currently located. This would mean that if the Hero Party Marker is on the Entrance or spaces 15-11 a 7+ would need to be rolled, if the Hero Party Marker in on spaces 10-6 an 8+ would need to be rolled, and if the Hero Party Marker is on spaces 5-1 or the Darkness Start space, a 9+ would need to be rolled.  

### Stages of the Track
The Depth Track is broken into 3 Stages, and each Stage has a value printed at the bottom (the Top Stage 7+, Middle Stage 8+, and Bottom Stage 9+). As the Hero Party marker moves down the track, it passes through these different Stages, making it progressively harder for the Heroes to Hold Back the Darkness.  

### Holding Back the Darkness
At the start of each Turn, the Hero with the Light Source must roll a Hold Back  the Darkness test. The Hero rolls 2D6 and adds them together. If the number is equal to or greater than the value needed (listed at the bottom of the Stage that the Hero Party marker is currently in), the Darkness has been held and the marker does not move this turn. If the roll is less than the value needed, the Darkness moves one step forward on the track (closer to the Entrance). The Hero Party may only have one Light Source active at a time.  

Important: Grit may **not** be used to Re-roll a Hold Back the Darkness test!  

### Blood Spatter Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Blood Spatter space, the Heroes must immediately draw a Darkness card as the Darkness has grown stronger.  

### Growing Dread Spaces
When the Darkness marker moves onto a Growing Dread space, the Heroes must draw a Growing Dread card as the deadly nature of the Hero’s mission sinks in. 

Blood Spatter and Growing Dread spaces only matter for the Darkness Marker, not the Hero Party Marker.  

### Depth Events
Any time the Hero with the Light Source rolls natural doubles for the Hold Back the Darkness test, a Depth Event has occurred! Even if the roll would normally have failed, instead of moving the Darkness marker, consult the Depth Event Chart to see what has happened (the Depth Event Chart can be found on one of the large reference cards).  

There are 6 possible results on the chart, and the Event that has occurred is the one listed for the double number that was rolled (double 1s = 1 on the chart, double 2s = 2 on the chart, etc). This is usually something bad that has happened.  

Occasionally something else will require a Depth Event to be triggered (such as an Exploration Token). When this happens, simply roll a D6 to see which Depth Event is triggered.  

### Darkness Marker
This marks the current position of the Darkness on the Depth Track and moves up the track over the course of the game, as the Darkness tries to escape! The Darkness Marker always starts on the Darkness Start space unless Mission special rules say otherwise.      

### Hero Party Marker
This marks the current position of the Heroes on the Depth Track and moves down the track as the Heroes explore the map. The Hero Party Marker always starts on the Entrance space, unless Mission special rules say otherwise.

## The Game Turn
Each Game Turn has four steps that are completed in the
following order:  

1. Hold Back the Darkness
2. Models Activate in Initiative Order
3. Room Exploration
4. End of the Turn

Once all 4 steps are complete, a new Game Turn begins.  

### Hold Back the Darkness
As noted earlier, at the start of each turn, the Hero that has
the Light Source must roll the Hold Back the Darkness test
to prevent the Darkness marker from moving forward on the
Depth Track. This test occurs at the start of every turn (even
during a Fight), and the longer the Adventure goes, the harder
it is to hold the Darkness back.  

### Models Activate in Initiative Order
After the Hold Back the Darkness test is complete, each
model is Activated in order of Initiative, from highest to lowest.
A model’s Initiative can be found in the upper right corner of
their Hero Character Sheet or Enemy Record Sheet.  

During most turns of the game, only Heroes will be on
the board as they explore the map. During a Fight however,
Activations will often be intermixed between Heroes and
Enemies, based on their relative Initiative scores (more on
Enemies and Fights later).  

Heroes that are tied for Initiative may decide
between them who will go first, and this may be
changed from turn to turn.  

### Room Exploration
When the Heroes discover a new Room Map Tile, it has
an Exploration Token placed on it. Exploration Tokens like
this are revealed and resolved during the Room Exploration
step (note that Passage Map Tiles do not have an Exploration
Token as indicated on each Passage Map Card).  

### End of the Turn
After all models have been Activated and any new Rooms
have been explored, anything that occurs at the End of the
Turn happens. If there are multiple effects that trigger at the
End of the Turn, the Heroes may decide what order to do
them in.  

## Hero Activation
When a Hero is Activated, they may Move and then
either Search or make an Attack. Searching may NOT be
done during a Fight (as the Hero is a little busy).  

### Hero Movement
At the start of a Hero’s Activation, the first thing they
should do is to roll a single D6 for Movement. The Hero
may Move a number of spaces up to the amount rolled on
the die.  

Models have no facing and may move forward, back, side
to side, and even diagonally. Models may NOT move through
other models or through Walls, and may only move into valid
spaces on the board (it must be at least 50% of a full space, to
be considered a valid space).  

The two half-spaces of an open-ended puzzle connection
on a Map Tile are considered to be Doorways and models
MAY move into these half-spaces.  

If a Hero rolls a 1 on their Move roll, they
are allowed to Recover one Grit. This is the
main method for Heroes getting Grit during
the game. If a Hero is already at their Max
Grit, they may immediately use the new Grit
on the spot, usually to add an extra D6 to their
Movement.  

Note that using Grit to add an extra D6 to your movement
does not let you Recover another Grit if you roll a 1 on that
D6, as it is simply extra movement, not a Move roll.  

### Map Tile Puzzle Connections
It is important to note that a Hero standing in a puzzle
connection space (between two Map Tiles) counts as being on
both of those Map Tiles. This can be important for Abilities
or effects that target every model on a specific Map Tile.  

### Barriers
Some spaces on the board have one
or more edges with a thick, white line.
These are called Barriers and usually
represent elevation changes or obstacles
that prevent movement but can be seen
through, such as cliffs or low walls.  

Only models that have an ability allowing them to ‘Move
through other models’ may cross these Barrier space edges
during their move. This usually includes models that can fly,,
models that have the ability to leap or climb over obstacles, or
XL-sized Enemies that can smash through them.  

When a Barrier extends slightly beyond the cross point
of multiple spaces, it prevents normal diagonal movement that
would cross this extended end of the Barrier as well.  

Barriers have NO EFFECT on Line of Sight for Ranged
Attacks, adjacency for Escape tests, or Melee Attacks; they
ONLY affect movement. Barriers do NOT prevent random
directional movement using the Bounce chart.  

If a model that can’t move through Barriers ever finds
itself trapped in an area surrounded by Walls/Barriers, it may
move through a Barrier to get out.  

### Walls Blocking Diagonal Movement
As noted above, models may not move or see through
Walls (the thick black border around every Map Tile).
Sometimes a Wall will extend into a Map Tile, covering over
the grid cross point between spaces.  

Walls like this prevent models from moving diagonally
across that Wall. In addition, because the Wall extends between
these diagonal spaces (covering the cross point of the spaces),
the two spaces are NOT considered to be adjacent to one
another. Walls like this block Line of Sight for Ranged Attacks,
prevent diagonal Melee Attacks across them, and prevent other
things like Fear or requiring Escape tests to move away from
Enemies that are diagonally across the Wall.  

### The Light Source and Voices in the Dark
The light from the Light Source is the only safety from the
shadows. It illuminates the entire Map Tile that the Hero
carrying it is currently on, as well as every adjacent Map
Tile. (Note that this includes every individual space on each of
these Map Tiles, regardless of Walls, Line of Sight, etc).  

Any Hero starting their Activation on a Map Tile that is
not within this light (on the same or adjacent Map Tile as the
Light Source) begins hearing ‘Voices in the Dark’, slowly
driving them mad. That Hero immediately takes D6 Horror
Hits.  

### Searching
There are two different types of Searching a Hero can do at
the end of their Movement, when not in a Fight - Scavenging
or Looking through a Door. Note that you may do either of
these things, not both.  

A Hero may not Search on a Map Tile (Scavenge or Look Through a Door) while there is an unrevealed Exploration
Token on that Tile (more on Exploration Tokens later).  

### Scavenging
Any Hero that ends their Move on a Map
Tile (Room, Passage, or the Entrance) that has
not yet been fully Scavenged may attempt to
search the area for anything of value.  

To Scavenge a Map Tile, roll 3 dice. If any of
the dice roll a 6, you have successfully Scavenged the area and
found something! Place a Scavenged marker on the Map Tile.
Then draw one card from the Scavenge Deck for each 6 that
was rolled. Note - only 1 Scavenged marker is placed, regardless
of how many 6s were rolled.  

As noted before, there is no discard pile for the Scavenge
Deck. Each time a Hero needs to draw one or more Scavenge
cards, shuffle the entire Scavenge Deck to draw the number of
cards needed. Note that the Scavenge Deck is approximately
1/3 good, 1/3 bad, and 1/3 nothing, so Scavenging may not
always end up being a benefit to your Hero (but it’s usually
fun to try).  

Each Map Tile may be Scavenged a number of times,
based on how many Heroes are in the Hero Party, before it is
considered fully Scavenged (and may not be Scavenged again).  

- 1-2 Heroes: 1 Scavenge
- 3-4 Heroes: 2 Scavenge
- 5-6 heroes: 3 Scavenge

### Looking Through a Door
Open-ended puzzle connections on a Map Tile (not
blocked off with an End Cap) are considered to be Doors. A
Hero that ends their Move on one of these open-ended puzzle
connection half-spaces may Search by Looking Through the
Door, seeing into the next Map Tile.  

Draw a Map Card and place the Map Tile shown as the
next piece of the board, connected to the Door that the Hero
is looking through. The green arrow on the card shows the
‘Entrance’ to the new Map Tile that should be connected to
the Door.  

If the new Map Tile cannot be placed because it would
overlap an existing Map Tile, rotate the tile to use one of the
other exits as the Entrance. If the tile still does not fit, discard
it and draw a new Map Card to repeat the same process. If the
second Map Tile also does not fit, this exit is not a valid Door
and should be blocked with an End Cap. Any exit that clearly
cannot fit a Map Tile should not be counted when determining
which exits from the Room are Doors (as described in the
section on Exploration below).  

Whenever a new Map Tile is placed, move
the Hero Party marker one step forward on the
Depth Track, showing their progression deeper
into the unexplored area.  

Any time a Hero Looks Through a Door and places a
new Map Tile, that Hero gains 5 XP for exploring.  

The Hero Party marker will no longer move if it ever
reaches the Darkness Start space of the Depth Track.  

Note that Heroes may not look through Doors while
there are Enemies on the board as Searching cannot be
performed during a Fight.  

### Hero Attacks
During their Activation, after moving, a Hero is allowed
to make one Attack. This is covered later in the section on
Fights.  

## Exploration
Exploration is a big part of Shadows of Brimstone, and
allows the Heroes an element of discovery as they pick their
way through the dark halls and rooms of the unexplored area.  

There are two types of Map Tiles, Passages and Rooms.
Passages are short pathways that simply connect different areas
together. Rooms, on the other hand, often hold Encounters or
Enemies that the Heroes must face.  

Whenever a Room Map Tile is placed, draw an
Exploration Token without looking at it and place
it face down on that Map Tile. Passages do not
contain Exploration Tokens and are labeled as such
on their individual Map Cards.  

Once the Map Tile is placed, the Hero that looked through
the Door will be standing in a puzzle connection space that is
half on each Map Tile. As noted above, a Hero on a puzzle
connection space like this is considered to be on BOTH Map
Tiles. This means that during the Room Exploration step of the
turn (after all Heroes have Activated), this Exploration Token
will be revealed as there will be at least one Hero on the Map
Tile with it.  

### Revealing Exploration Tokens
When an Exploration Token is revealed
(after all Heroes have Activated), flip it over
so that all players can see what has been
discovered! An Exploration Token has three
important pieces of information – Door / Gate
Icons (showing the Number of exits the
Room has), Encounters or Attacks!, and if
there are any Clues for the Heroes’ current
Mission. There are also Exploration Tokens
that draw a Darkness card (more on Darkness
later) or have the Heroes roll a Depth Event.  

### Door/Gate Icons
At the top of the Exploration Token you
will find one or more Door Icons {Door}. Each Icon
represents an exit from the Room. So if there
are 2 Door Icons on the Token, there will be 2
Random puzzle connection ‘Doors’ left open on
the Room. On the Map Card for the Room, each
potential exit is marked with a set of numbers to
help randomly determine where the Doors are to be left open.
For each Door Icon, roll a die and consult the Map Card
to determine where that Door will be (roll again if there is
already a Door there). Each puzzle connection exit that is not
a Door should be closed off using an End Cap piece.  

Additional rules for Gates {Gate} are covered in a later section.  

### Encounters and Attack!
Exploration Tokens will always lead to Encounters or an
Attack, both of which are covered a little later on.  

### Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens
The Exploration Token with Darkness
on it requires the Heroes to draw a Darkness
card, while the Token with a Depth Event has
the Heroes roll a D6 and trigger the Depth
Event that corresponds to the number rolled.  

### Clue Icons
Many of the Exploration Tokens have Clue Icons {C}
on them, representing important bits of information
that help the Heroes on their Mission. Clue Icons have
different meanings based on the particular Mission being
played, as described in the Mission entry of the Adventure
Book (some Missions do not use Clue Icons at all).  

### Finding the Objective
When the final Clue Icon needed is found (or whatever
the particular Mission calls for is discovered), the Heroes have
found their Objective!  

This usually means that the Heroes ignore any Door Icons
and Encounters/Attacks on the final Exploration Token (Note
that the Darkness and Depth Event Exploration Tokens still
trigger the Darkness/Depth Event). Instead, the Heroes have
reached their goal and must face a final fight with a larger or
meaner group of Enemies. In the Advanced Game, this comes
in the form of an Epic Threat boss fight. In the introductory
Mission, ‘Scouting Party’, it means fighting a higher level Threat
card of Enemies than normal.  

## Visual Description of Map Tiles
The physical Map Tile components are described in this section so they may assist an AI in understanding and tracking how they are physically placed on the table. Using a shorthand text description to describe a particular Map Tile may even help an AI be able to track where models are placed within the squares of the tile during a Fight so as to assist in playing the game.  

The Map Tiles that are included in various Core, Adventure, and Expansion boxes are flat cardboard tiles that take on various 2D shapes and have artwork depicted on both sides of the 2D tile. The different art work on either side of a particular Map Tile correspond to two different World Locations (e.g., one side might be a tile for the Mines, while the other depicts a location in the Swampsof Jargono).

The edges of the map tiles are black bordered walls and almost every Map Tile has at least two puzzle-cut spaces for connecting to other randomly drawn Map Tiles. Entrance Map Tiles and End Caps only have a single puzzle-cut connector space. 

The artwork depicted on the tile is from a top-down perspective and highly evocative to help visually represent the Heroes walking through the location when the Hero miniatures are placed on the tile. The artwork is split up into a square grid, about 1" square, to regulate miniature movement across the tile. Each square on the Map Tile is called a space.  

Some of the black bordered walls and edges of the map tile will bleed into some of the edges on the Map Tile, creates spaces that are partially filled with artwork depicting the location and partially depicting the black bordered wall. Spaces with at least 50% of the square covered by artwork is still considered a valid space for models to occupy.  

Spaces occupied by puzzle-cut edges are also considered valid spaces and may be occupied by models wither there is another Map Tile connected or not. Every puzzle-cut connection on ever Map Tile in Shadows of Brimstone is two spaces wide to ensure that all Map Tiles can be connected to one another.  

## Winning and Losing
To Win a Mission, the Heroes must find the Objective and
defeat any Enemies guarding it, as detailed in the particular
Mission being played. For the basic ‘Scouting Party’ Mission,
the Heroes simply need to find the Objective room at the
second Clue Icon and defeat the Enemies there.  

There are two main ways for the Heroes to Fail any
Mission - if all of the Heroes are KO’d or if the Darkness
Escapes.  

### All Heroes KO'd
If all of the Heroes are ever KO’d at the same time,
the Mission immediately ends in failure. The Heroes are
considered to escape, but must all still roll for Injury/Madness.  

### Darkness Escapes
If the Darkness marker ever reaches the Entrance space on
the Depth Track, the Darkness escapes and lays waste to the
countryside. The Mission is failed and the Heroes must head
home in defeat.  

### Running Away
Sometimes things look pretty grim. If all of the Heroes
agree (at least all those that are not yet KO’d), at the start of
any turn, the Hero Party may elect to Flee from the Adventure!
This must be done before anything else in the turn happens.
All of the Heroes (including those that are KO’d) escape and
the Mission is considered to have been failed. Any Heroes that
were KO’d still need to roll for Injury/Madness.  

## Darkness and the Growing Dread
### Darkness Cards
Darkness cards are evil events that can cause Enemies to
leap from the shadows, ceilings to collapse, supernatural events
to occur, or allow the Darkness to steadily grow in power with
cards that Remain in Play. Darkness cards are pretty much
always bad for the Heroes.  

There are two main ways for Darkness cards to be drawn
during the game, whenever the Darkness marker reaches a
Blood Spatter space on the Depth Track, and whenever a
card’s game text instructs the players to do so (this is usually
caused by Scavenge or Encounter cards).  

When a Darkness card is drawn, it is read aloud to all
players, starting with the card title, and then its game effect is
resolved. Once complete, the card is discarded (unless it is
marked as Remains in Play at the bottom of the card).  
### Growing Dread Cards
Growing Dread cards are dark and powerful events that
can spell doom for the Heroes. Unlike Darkness cards, they
are usually not played immediately when drawn. Instead,
whenever a Growing Dread card is drawn, it is placed face
down, without looking at it, in a stack near the Depth Track.
Growing Dread cards are always added to the top of the stack,
and can be fanned out a little so that players can see how many
cards are in the stack. In this way, it creates an impending
feeling of doom over the course of the game as more cards get
added to the stack, with each being potentially deadly!  
### Resolving Growing Dread
When the Objective is found for the current Mission, but
before any Threat cards are drawn or Enemies placed, the
cards in the Growing Dread stack are revealed and resolved,
one at a time, starting from the top of the stack. For the
remainder of this Objective, if any new Growing Dread cards
would be added to the stack, instead resolve them immediately.  
### Canceling Growing Dread
The Heroes are not helpless though. A Growing Dread
card may be canceled if all of the Heroes in the Party collectively
use 1 Grit each (not including Heroes that are KO’d). This
may be done while a Growing Dread card is still face down
(cancel the top card of the stack), or once it has been revealed
(before it takes effect).  

## Health, Sanity and Corruption
There are many ways that a Hero can get hurt while fighting their way through an Adventure (or even just while walking
through the demon-infested wilderness). Every Hero has Health, that measures their ability to take physical damage before
being knocked out, and Sanity, that covers their ability to take mental strain before going mad. It is also possible to be corrupted
by dark influences and even start to mutate from it.  

### Types of Hits
There are 3 types of Hits that a Hero can take - Hits,
Horror Hits, and Corruption Hits.  

- Hits: Hits represent physical damage and cause Wounds if not
prevented.
- Horror Hits: Horror Hits represent mental strain and cause Sanity
Damage if not prevented.
- Corruption Hits: Corruption Hits represent dark influence and cause
Corruption Points if not prevented.

### Defense and Willpower
Each Hero has Defense and Willpower marked on their
character sheets. Both of these are saving rolls that allow the
Hero to try and prevent incoming Hits from doing damage.
Defense is used to prevent Hits while Willpower is used to
prevent both Horror Hits and Corruption Hits.  

Anytime a Hero takes one or more Hits, they may make
a Defense roll against each, needing to roll equal to or higher
than their Defense value to prevent the Hit. For example, if
a Hero has a Defense of 4+ and takes 3 Hits, they would roll
3 Defense dice with each roll of 4, 5, or 6 preventing one of
the incoming Hits. For each Defense roll that failed, the Hero
would take damage from that Hit.  

Willpower works exactly the same way, but is used for
incoming Horror Hits and Corruption Hits instead.  

### Types of Damage
**Wounds**  
Wound markers are placed on a Hero’s
Character Sheet (or Enemy) to show that they
have taken damage against their Health. Each
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Wound unless
stated otherwise.  

**Sanity Damage**  
anity Damage markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to show that they
have taken damage against their Sanity. Each
Horror Hit that is not prevented does 1 Sanity
Damage unless stated otherwise.  

**Corrupton Points**  
Corruption Point markers are placed on
a Hero’s Character Sheet to track how much
Corruption they have gained. Each Corruption
Hit that is not prevented does 1 Corruption Point.  

### Cover
Sometimes a model will have a special Cover save allowing
them to try and block each incoming Hit they are about to
take. Cover saves work similar to a Defense roll (stopping
an entire Hit when successfully rolled), but are made before
Defense rolls. In addition, a model with a Cover save may still
roll for it, even if the Hit ignores its Defense.  

### Shields
A Shield is an Item that a Hero may carry allowing them
to block some amount of incoming Damage (as listed on the
Item). A Shield must be equipped to be used and usually takes
one of the Hero’s Hand Slots.  

A Shield may be used to prevent Damage
after any Cover and Defense rolls are made, but
must be used before any Armor rolls are made.  

### Amor and Spirit Armor
Armor helps to protect a Hero, even
after their Defense or Willpower has failed
them. Armor protects against Wounds
while Spirit Armor protects against Sanity
Damage. Neither one helps against
Corruption though.  

If a Hero has an Item or ability that
gives them Armor, whenever they are
about to take a number of Wounds (after
Defense rolls and any use of a Shield), roll a D6 for
each individual Wound they are about to take. For each die
roll that is equal to or better than their Armor save, that Wound
is prevented. For example, if a Hero has Armor 5+ and takes two
Hits past their Defense that do 3 Wounds each, the Hero rolls 6 dice.
For every 5 or 6 rolled, one of the incoming Wounds is prevented.  

Spirit Armor works the same way, but allows the Hero to
roll of each point of incoming Sanity Damage instead.  

A Hero may not apply more than one Armor save at a
time (from different Items/abilities), but only uses the best
Armor save they currently have equipped.  

Some Enemies can also have Armor as an ability. This
works just like a Hero’s Armor.  

### Being KO'd
If a Hero ever has Wounds equal to their
Health or Sanity Damage equal to their Sanity,
they are immediately KO’d (Knocked Out),
and no more Wounds/Sanity Damage will be
applied (you cannot fall below 0). Remove
the Hero model from the board and place
a KO’d Hero marker in their space. Other
models may freely move into and through a
space with a KO’d Hero.  

### Recovering
At the end of any turn when there are no Enemies
anywhere on the board, a KO’d Hero may Recover. That
Hero places their model back on the board, removing the
KO’d Hero marker and pushing any model that was in their
space to an adjacent space. They then roll once on the Injury
Chart if their Health was reduced to 0 or the Madness Chart
if their Sanity was reduced to 0. They also get to Heal 2D6
Wounds/Sanity (any mix). This Healing must bring their
Health and Sanity back to at least 1 each.  

If a Hero was reduced to 0 in both Health and Sanity at
the same time, they must roll once on each Chart, but then get
to Heal 2D6 Health and 2D6 Sanity.  

### Revive Tokens
Revive Tokens are a special bonus that
allow the Heroes to overcome otherwise dire
situations. Usually Revive Tokens are held by
the entire Party as a whole rather than by an
individual Hero. Whenever a Hero would be
KO’d, if there are one or more Revive Tokens available, that
Hero may discard a Revive Token to instead be immediately
restored to Full Health and Full Sanity, and Recover 1 Grit.
The Hero does NOT need to roll for Injury or Madness when
using a Revive Token, and ignores any remaining incoming
Hits or Damage from the source that would have KO’d them.  

## Healing

### Healing Health and Sanity
Whenever a Hero is allowed to Heal Health or Sanity
Damage, they simply remove that number of damage markers
from their character. When a Hero is allowed to Fully Heal
Wounds or Sanity Damage, they get to remove all damage
markers of that type from their character.  

### Healing Other Heroes
Any time a Hero Heals Wounds or Sanity Damage from
another Hero (regardless of the method), they gain 5 XP for
each Wound/Sanity healed.  

Tokens like Rum and Bandages may be used to Heal other
Heroes that are adjacent to you during a Fight, or even just on
the same Map Tile while there are no Enemies on the board.  

### Corrupton and Mutation
Fighting nightmarish creatures and working around Dark
Stone can be hazardous, not just to your health and sanity,
but to your soul! As Heroes gain Corruption Points, they
will begin to mutate and change over time. A Hero’s ability to
withstand these effects is called their Corruption Resistance.  

### Corruption Resistance Value
Every Hero starts with a default Corruption Resistance
value of 5. This means that a Hero may only ‘hold’ up to 4
Corruption Points at a time without any ill effect. As soon as
the Hero has 5 Corruption Points (Corruption equal to their
Corruption Resistance value), those Corruption are removed
and the Hero must immediately roll once on the Mutation
chart.  

A Hero’s Corruption Resistance value may be modified by
Items they acquire, events they encounter on their Adventures,
and any number of other things in the game, causing that
Hero to be able to ‘hold’ more or fewer Corruption Points
before they mutate.  

### Rolling For Mutation
To roll on the Mutation chart, a Hero must roll a ‘D36’.
To roll a D36, roll two dice of different colors, where one
of them is the ‘10’s digit and the other is the ‘1’s digit. For
Example, if your rolled 3 and 5 the result on the chart would
be 35.  

### Mutation Death
If a Hero ever rolls a Mutation on the chart that they already
currently have, they have instead mutated beyond recognition
and have become little more than a writhing mass of tentacles
and goo. That Hero is considered to be Dead (though they
may still be Resurrected in Camp between Adventures).  

## A Random Hero
There are many things in the game that require you to
determine a Random Hero. There are two simple ways to do
this - use the Hero Tokens provided to draw one
randomly, or simply roll a die.  
A Hero Token for each Hero in this Set
has been provided and these can be used to
draw from without looking to determine a
Random Hero.  
Alternatively, it is often faster and easier
to simply point to the different Heroes or Players and assign
each a number set, then roll a die to see which is selected.
For instance, if there are 3 Heroes you could say Hero A is
1-2, Hero B is 3-4, and Hero C is 5-6, then roll a D6. Keep
in mind that the D8 also works great for this if there are 4
Heroes (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8).  

## Encounters and Skill Tests
Often times Heroes will come across aspects of the environment or situations that they need to try to overcome or deal with
using their Skills. These are called Encounters and are most often found as part of an Exploration Token while investigating a
room. Encounters can range from a blazing fire to a ghostly apparition, or anything in between.  

### Hero Skills
Every Hero has a set of six Skills that they use to interact
with Encounters, overcome dangerous challenges, and that
define the Hero’s mental and physical prowess.  
A Hero’s Skill values range from 1 to 6. Each of these
values may never be modified to go below 1 or above 6.  

**Agility**  
Used for running, jumping, diving, and rolling, Agility is
tested for challenges that require physical dexterity and stealth.  
**Cunning**  
The ability to understand technology, to outwit opponents,
and to solve puzzles, Cunning is used for challenges that
require the Hero to think their way past a problem.  
**Spirit**  
Used for interacting with the supernatural and the Void,
Spirit determines how good the Hero is at overcoming
demonic and ghostly Encounters as well as mental fortitude.  
**Strength**  
Physical brawn and brute force, Strength determines how
good the Hero is at overpowering things and influences how
far they can throw an item or how much weight they can carry.  
**Lore**  
Knowledge of myth and legend, Lore determines a Hero’s
ability to decipher ancient languages and riddles as well as to
tell stories and interact with occult elements.  
**Luck**  
One cannot underestimate the power of being lucky. Of
course, this has just as much to do with a Hero’s ability to
minimize the effects of bad luck while capitalizing on any
good fortune that comes their way.  

### Encounters
When the Heroes find an Exploration Token that says
Encounter on it, they must draw a card from the Encounter
Deck to see what they have found. Encounters are situations that the Heroes must overcome
to continue on their Mission.
Usually Encounters will have
one or more Skill tests that the
Heroes need to perform.  
Encounters affect all
Heroes, not just those that are
currently in the same room
(though some Encounters
are listed specifically as only
affecting Heroes that are on
the Map Tile). Heroes that are
currently in another World
do NOT participate.  
### Who Takes the Test
Skill tests on an Encounter are
marked with an icon to show who must take the test.  
- {One Hero} One Hero: One Hero is chosen to make the
Skill test. The Heroes must decide amongst
themselves who will take it.
- {All Heroes} All Heroes: Every Hero must make the Skill test.
- {One Random} One Random: One Hero, chosen randomly,
must make the Skill test.

### Making a Skill Test
To make a Skill test, the Hero rolls a number of dice
equal to their value in that Skill. As long as any one of those
dice is equal to or greater than the target number, the test is
successfully passed.  
For example, if a Hero needs to make a Lore 5+ test, they roll
a number of dice equal to their Lore Skill. As long as one of those
dice rolls a 5 or higher, the test is passed. If not, the test is failed.  

### Skill Tests Outside of an Encounter
Sometimes Heroes will be called on to make a Skill test
outside of an Encounter. This most often occurs because of
special Enemy abilities or between Adventures while in Camp.
These Skill tests work the same way, and it should be clear by
the Event or card text who needs to make the test (usually the
Hero that rolled the Event).  

### Multiple Encounters
Sometimes an Exploration Token will call for multiple
Encounters (For Example - Encounters x2). When this occurs,
draw all of the needed Encounters and resolve them in any
order you like. The only important thing to note is that any
Enemies that Attack as a result of an Encounter will not be
placed or start the Fight until all of the other non-Enemy
aspects of the Encounters have been completed (so all Skill
tests, etc. must be taken before Enemies are placed on the
board). This can result in multiple Enemy Attacks at once.  


## XP and Gold
XP and Gold are only needed when keeping Heroes
from one Adventure to the next, and are gathered in large
quantities, so no counters are included for them. Instead, it is
recommended that players track their XP and Gold by keeping
a running total of each on a piece of paper.  

## Cards
There are many different decks of cards in the game that
are used for everything from dynamically generating the board
as you explore it, to the Enemies you encounter, to the cool
Gear and Artifacts you find along the way.  

**Keywords**  
Most cards have Keywords associated with them, listed
just below the title of the card. The Keywords usually do not
have any inherent meaning, but are occasionally referenced by
other cards and rules.  

**Icons**  
Many cards contain icons that represent various aspects
of the card. A full list of these icons can be found on the
Reference Summary at the back of this Rulebook.  

**Remains in Play**  
Some cards are listed as Remains in Play. As it sounds,
these cards stay in play and continue to affect the game until
the end of the Adventure, or they are canceled in some way.  

**Discard Piles**  
For each deck of cards in the game there will also be a
discard pile. The discard pile should be formed face up next to
the deck and is where cards from that deck go when they have
been used and are no longer in play. Any player may look
through any discard pile at any time. If any deck ever runs
out of cards, shuffle the discard pile thoroughly and reform the
deck face down.  

Some of the card decks (such as Loot and Scavenge cards)
do not have discard piles, but rather are fully shuffled every
time one or more cards need to be drawn.  

## Card Types

### Gear and Artifact Cards
Gear and Artifact cards represent different items and pieces of equipment that a Hero can collect and use to help them on
their adventures. Gear are more common items that can be found and are often a bit more disposable. Artifacts are more rare
and powerful items that usually have occult or magical origins, or come from another world altogether.  

### Items
There are a few limiting factors that restrict how many
Items that a Hero may carry and use at any given time.  
**Hands**  
Each Hero has 2 Hand slots that they can assign Items
to each turn. This can be up to two different Single-Handed
Items or one Double-Handed Item.  
- {Single Handed} Single Handed: This Item requires one of the Hero's two Hand slots to have equipped during the turn.
- {Double Handed} Double Handed: This Item requires both of the Hero’s Hand slots
to have equipped during the turn.

At the start of a Hero’s Activation each turn, the Hero
may decide what Items they want to assign to their two Hand
slots. Any of the Hero’s other unassigned Items that require
one or two Hands to use, do not give the Hero any benefit
from their card text.  
Note that assigning Items to your Hand slots ‘at the start
of your Activation’ is usually only important during a Fight
and it is assumed that the Hero can swap different Items into
and out of their Hands when there are no Enemies on the
board. You may still only ever use two Hand slots at any given
time though.  

**Weight and Caryying Limit**  
Many Items have one or more small Weight
icons {Anvil} on them to show that they are limited.  
Hero may only carry 5 + their Strength
in Weight icons {Anvil} at any time.  

**Keyword Restrictions**  
Some Items have a red restriction bar that requires a Hero
to have a certain Keyword to be able to use the Item. For
example, if an Item says Strange Only, the Hero must have
the Keyword Strange to use the Item.  

**Clothing Items**  
Occasionally an Item will have the
Keyword Clothing followed by one
or more other Keywords that tell the
Clothing Slot that the Item fills (Torso,
Shoulders, Gloves, Coat, etc). These
Items can be very powerful, but a Hero
is limited to only a single Clothing
Item for each unique Clothing Slot. So
a Hero may only have one Clothing
- Gloves equipped at any given time,
as well as one Clothing - Coat and
one Clothing - Hat, etc.  

**Items with Limited Use**  
Some Items are limited in how often they can be used.
These Items are marked as ‘Once Per Turn’, ‘Once Per Fight’,
‘Once Per Adventure’, etc. When a Limited Use Item like this
is used, rotate the card or flip the card over to Exhaust it
(show that it has been used). You may Ready that card (unrotate
or flip it back over to show that it may be used again)
when the time frame of its limitation is complete.  
So for instance, a ‘Once Per Turn’ Item should be
Exhausted when used, and then be Readied at the end of the
current Turn, while a ‘Once Per Fight’ Item would be Readied
at the end of the current Fight.  
This terminology is also used for some Abilities.  

### Personal Items
Personal Items are very powerful and characterful cards
that are unique. Every new Hero character gets to draw
one Personal Item to give them a special bonus as well as
to thematically help fill in the backstory of the character. If
a Duelist gets the War Veteran’s Dagger, perhaps she has seen
death up close during the wars in Europe! Or perhaps she
took it as a trophy from the first opponent she ever defeated
in a duel.  
Personal Items may never be traded, lost, sold, or
discarded in any way. They help to define who the Hero is
and the Hero will carry it till the day they die.  

### Dark Stone Icons
{Dark Stone} Some Items have a Dark Stone Icon on them,
usually in the upper left corner. This means that
the Item is charged with Dark Stone energy in
some way and counts as one Dark Stone when
considering how much Dark Stone a Hero is carrying.  

### Item Upgrades
Many Items have the capacity to be upgraded to give
them extra benefits or abilities. These Items have one or more
Upgrade Slots on them, shown at the bottom left of the card.  

**Upgrade Slots**  
{Upgrade Slot}  
{Upgrade Required Slot}  
Items often have up to 3 Upgrade Slots
on it, with each Slot represented as an empty
circle. Upgrade Slots can be filled with an
Upgrade Item or with a Forged Dark Stone Upgrade added
to the Item by a blacksmith in Camp. These Upgrades will
have one or more Slot Requirements (filled in black circles)
to show how many Upgrade Slots they occupy
when attached to an Item.  

**Attaching an Upgrade**  
As noted above, Upgrades come in two forms, either as
a card that the Hero finds during an Adventure, or as Dark
Stone that is forged directly onto the Item in Town.  
An Upgrade card lists on it what it can be attached to as
well as if it takes any resources to attach it to an Item (usually
Dark Stone).  
When an Upgrade card is
attached to an Item, it fills in a
number of Upgrade Slots equal to
its Slot Requirement and gives that
Item the listed Bonus.  
Upgrade cards attached to an
Item can be removed at any time
so that they can be attached to
a different Item, sold, etc. The
resources used to attach the
Upgrade originally are lost.  
Dark Stone that is Forged
directly onto an Item
is a permanent change and may
not be removed. It is now part
of the Item.  

### Side Bag
Each Hero has a Side
Bag that is used to carry
helpful Side Bag Tokens
like Rum, Bandages,
Bomb, Tonic, etc. A Side
Bag may hold up to 5
Tokens on it at a time
and these can be any
mixture of different Side
Bag Tokens.  

**Side Bag Tokens**  
Side Bag Tokens are generally small ‘discard to
use’ objects that a Hero may have more than one of. A Side
Bag Token can be identified by its parchment background and
green title bar for the name of the Token.  
Generally, Side Bag Tokens may be used at any time
(unless used as an Attack/Free Attack, which must be during
your Activation).  
A complete reference of all Side Bag Tokens is found later in this reference.  
## Creating A New Hero
Creating a new Hero is fast and easy. It is often just as fun
to start a fresh new Hero as it is to keep one Hero from game
to game, over a series of Adventures. To create a new Hero,
just follow these simple steps:  

### Choose Hero Class (and Sub-Class)
The most important choice for a new Hero is what
Hero Class you want to play, and for a Team Hero like the
Conquistadors, Vikings, or Trederran Strike Team, what Sub-Class you want to play.  
Each Hero Class/Sub-Class has its own unique stats and Abilities,
and a fairly different play style.  
Most standard Hero Classes have no Sub-Class. But Adventure Sets use Team Heroes. In the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set, 
the Heroes are the Conquistador Hero Class, but there are 4
different Sub-Classes of Conquistador to choose from - El
Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier.  

### Get Starting Items
Every Hero Class/Sub-Class has a small list of Starting
Items printed on their Character Sheet that they get for free.
Find these Items for your Hero amongst the Starting Gear
cards. It is important to note that, in many ways, the Starting
Gear of a Hero is just as important a factor as their Abilities
and stats. Note that Heroes may NOT trade or give their
Starting Items to other Heroes.  

### Draw a Personal Item
Every Hero starts their adventuring career with one
Personal Item that not only gives them a powerful bonus,
but can help to define the backstory of that Hero. Draw one
Personal Item card for your Hero.  
Some Hero Classes draw from special themed decks of Personal Item Cards. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not specify a specific deck to draw your Personal Item card from, use the standard deck.

### Choose Your Starting Upgrade
When creating a brand new Hero you get to choose one of
the Hero Starting Upgrades available to your Hero Class. Each
Sub-Class of Conquistador has 2 unique Starting Upgrades
to choose from that help to define your Hero right from the
beginning. Choose wisely though as the Upgrade you don’t
pick will not be available later.  

### Get a Side Bag and Free Token
Take a Side Bag
marker for your Hero.
Every Hero has a Side
Bag that can hold up
to 5 Tokens in it. A
New Hero also gets
to choose one Side Bag
Token to start with for free.
Choose from Rum, Bandages, Tonic,
or Bomb.  

As new Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been released over the years, Heroes that were included in different sets are inteded to pick from a different pool of Side Bag Tokens for their free starting token. Heroes native to different settings and sets should pick from the starting tokens provided in the following table:  

- **Old West Heroes:**
(City of Ancients Core Set, Swamps of Death Core Set, The Impossible Hell Train Core Set, Various Hero Packs)  
  - Bandage
  - Whiskey
  - Tonic 
  - Dynamite

- **Feudal Japanese Heroes:**
(Forbidden Fortress Core Set, Various Hero Packs)
  - Bandage
  - Sake
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Spanish Fort Heroes:**
(Valley of the Serpent King Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - Rum
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Viking Heroes:**
(Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - ?
  - Tonic
  - ?

- **Trederran Team Heroes:**
(Trederran Strike Team Expansion)
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?

Some specific Heroes, such as a the Jargono Native, may have special rules which allow that Hero to start with a different Side Bag token. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not have specify any special tokens, use the previous tables to pick according to the native setting of your Hero's Class/Sub-Class.  

### Name Your Hero
Lastly, you should choose a
fitting name for your Hero. And pick
something good, you never know if that
name will be spoken of as legend in the
royal courts throughout Spain and the world
at large!  

## Adventure Set Up
An Adventure is generally a single play-session where the Heroes try to successfully complete a Mission. While players can choose to play a Campaign, keeping their Heroes across many Adventures and play-sessions, Shadows of Brimstone can also be played as just a single Adventure if players choose.  

To Set Up for an Adventure, complete the following steps in the order listed.  

### Number of Players/Heroes
Decide on the number of Heroes that will be taking part
in the Adventure. Usually this is one Hero per player, but
sometimes it is fun to play a game controlling two or more
Heroes each, for a fewer number of players.  

### Shuffle Card Decks
Thoroughly shuffle all of the required card decks and place them on the table. Most Adventures require the following decks of cards:  
- Darkness
- Growing Dread
- Loot
- Scavenge
- Low, Med, High, and Epic Threats
- Gear
- Artifacts
- Encounters
- Map Cards
- World Card

If playing an Adventure in an OtherWorld, you will need the Threat, Encounters, Map Cards, and Artifacts corresponding to that OtherWorld.  

Note that players may freely mix cards and other content across multiple Core Sets, Adventure Sets, and other expansions as they desire. For example, if playing an Adventure in the Forbidden Fortress as Fedual Japanese Heroes, the players may wish to only include Darkness, Growing Dread, Gear, and Threat cards intended for the Forbidden Fortress setting. Or, they may wish to include cards from any other content as desired!

For Loot and Scavenge decks, players are free to combine cards across multiple Core and Adventure Sets, but doing so is not recommended. The distribution of cards in these two decks provide a mix of good, neutral, and bad effects as intended by the designers.  

Don't forget to place an appropriate World Card face up on the table that matches the World in which your Adventure is taking place, as it may add special gameplay effects as depicted on the card.  

During your Adventures, you
may pass through Gates that allow you to visit strange
alien OtherWorlds. These Worlds each have their own World
card. Some Missions actually begin in an OtherWorld, as
listed in the Mission Set Up.  

### Prepare Exploration Tokens
Shuffle up all 8 Exploration Tokens and create a stack of
them face down that players can draw from when they find a
new room.  

Mixing Exploration Tokens from multiple Core and Adventure Sets is not recommended.

### Ready Heroes
Prepare each Hero that will be taking part. If these are
new Heroes, make sure each of them is ready to go using the
steps of Creating a New Hero.  

One Hero gets the Old Lantern card as the Light Source,
in addition to their other Gear. The players may choose who
will take it at the start of each Adventure.  

Draw Team Ability cards and add them to the pool if any players are using Team Heroes. 

Ensure each Hero has any necessary starting markers, tokens, etc., such as Grit, Ability Tokens (Ambition, Fury, Mana, etc.), free Side Bag Token, etc. 

### Select Mission
Select a Mission to play. For your first time learning the game, this should
be the first Basic Mission included in the Core Set or Adventure Set you are playing with.  

Players may use whatever methods the like to select a Mission. They may pick one by choice, select one randomly, or use whatever methodology they like.  

Note that some Missions have special Set Up instructions.  

### Prepare Depth Track
Place the Depth Track where all players can see it, and
position the Darkness marker on the Darkness Start space and
the Hero Party marker on the Entrance space. Note that some Missions may have special instructions which may modify these rules.  

### Place Entrance Map Tile
Set the Entrance Map Tile in the center of the table,
where all players can reach it.  

### Place Heroes
Lastly, each Hero model is placed on the Entrance Map
Tile in one of the 8 Starting Area spaces.  

The Starting Area on the Entrance Map Tile includes all
8 spaces in the back two rows. The
Heroes can be positioned in any of these eight spaces, and
should be placed on the board in Initiative order, from highest
to lowest.  

## Number of Heroes
The number of Heroes taking part in an Adventure
determines the difficulty and quantity of Enemies you will
be facing. This is scaled in two ways - with Low, Med,
and High Threat Decks for Enemies as well as with Revive
Tokens to help fewer Heroes survive a little longer.  

| Heroes | Scaling |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | Low Threats, 2 Revive Tokens |
| 2      | Low Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 3      | Med Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 4      | Med Threats |
| 5      | High Treats, 1 Revive Token |
| 6      | High Treats |

## Enemies
Every Enemy Type is represented by a large Enemy Record Sheet that lists its stats and abilities. The Record Sheets are
double-sided and have the normal (green) stats on one side, and the Brutal (red) stats on the other. The Brutal Enemy side is
generally only used for groups of Heroes that are quite experienced and have been through many Adventures.  

### Enemy Type
This tells the name of the specific Enemy Type, such as
Tentacles, Temple Guard, or Drowned Dead.  

### Keyword
All Enemies have one or more Keywords that define the
category they fall into (Demon, Myth, Void, etc). Generally
these Keywords don’t have any built-in meaning, but are often
referenced by other cards or abilities.  

### Size
The Size of the Enemy - Small, Medium, Large, Extra
Large, or even XXL.  

### Initiative
Just like Heroes, every Enemy has an Initiative that tells
when they get to Activate in the turn order.  

### Abilities
Most Enemies have one or more Special Abilities that
affect how they fight the Heroes.  

### Move
This is the number of spaces that the Enemy can move
during their Activation. Unlike Heroes, Enemies have a fixed
move which makes them predictable and easier to move in
large groups.  

### Escape
When a Hero is adjacent to the Enemy and wants to move
away, they must first pass an Escape test using this Escape
value (more on this a bit later).  

### 'To Hit' Values
Just like Heroes, Enemies have a To Hit value for Ranged
Attacks and Melee Attacks.  

### Combat
The number of Combat dice the Enemy gets to roll against
a Hero when making a Melee Attack.  

### Damage
The amount of Damage a Hero takes for each Enemy
Combat Hit they fail to block with their Defense.  

### Defense
Unlike a Hero’s Defense (which is a roll to block
Damage), an Enemy’s Defense is a fixed amount of Damage
that is prevented from each Hit the Enemy would take.  

### Health
The number of Wounds that it takes to kill the Enemy.  

### XP Value
Every Enemy is worth XP to the Hero that kills it.
Many larger or tougher Enemies give XP to a Hero just for
Wounding it.  

### Elite Chart
Every Enemy Type has an Elite Chart of six extra Abilities
that make it harder to defeat or more deadly in a Fight. When
a group of Enemies is Elite, they get to roll on the Chart to
see what extra Ability or Abilities that group of Enemies has.  

### Brutal Side
Brutal Enemy Side
The back side of each Enemy Record Sheet has the Brutal
version of that Enemy Type, displayed with a red background.
These Brutal Enemies are generally only encountered by higher
level Heroes that have played many Adventures. This is a way
of scaling the Enemies that the Heroes have to fight over the
course of a campaign.  

## Fights
When the Heroes come across a group of Enemies, their exploration of the area takes a back seat to fighting for their lives.
These engagements are called Fights and cover the time from when Enemies appear until the last Enemy is defeated and the
Fight is over. Fights make up the bulk of the action in the game and are an exciting way for the Heroes to get XP and Loot,
though they can also be quite dangerous.  

### Attack!
The most common way for a Fight to
begin is by finding an Attack Exploration
Token while Exploring a Room. When
an Attack occurs, the Heroes must draw a
Threat card to see what has attacked them.
Attacks can also be caused by other things
as well, such as Darkness cards, Encounters, a
Depth Event, etc.  

### Drawing Threat Cards
When a Fight begins,
the first thing that the
players need to do is find
out what Enemies are
actually attacking them.
Usually, this means drawing
a Threat card (though
sometimes the Attack will
call for a specific Type of
Enemy as listed on the card
or Event that caused the
Attack in the first place).  
To draw a Threat card,
you simply take the top card
from the Threat Deck of the
appropriate Threat Level. This
is based on the number of Heroes in the Party.
1-2 Heroes use the Low Threats (green), 3-4 Heroes use the
Med Threats (yellow), and 5-6 Heroes use the High Threats
(red).  

### Attacks by Specific Enemies
When a card or event calls for an Attack by a specific
Enemy Type, there is no need to draw a Threat card. Instead,
the Type and number of Enemies is pre-set and listed in the
text for that card/event.  

### Number of Enemy Models
Sometimes the number of Enemy
models that will be taking part in the Fight
is simply listed on the card. Many times,
however, it will be a variable number of
Enemies that the players must roll for, using
a D6, D3, or the Peril Die {P}.  
The Peril Die is a special 6-sided die that has
faces marked 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, and 6. This allows for a
variable number of Enemies to show up, but never
less than 3 at a time.  
The Peril die is represented on cards and text as
the symbol: {P}  
Sometimes multiple Peril Dice will be used to find
the number of Enemies for an Enemy Type that favors
larger groups. For instance, Tentacles often show up with
up to 12 Enemies at a time, and will frequently be listed
on a Threat card as:  
{P}{P} Tentacles  
In these cases, the Peril Die should be rolled twice and the
two numbers added together to find the total.  

### Placing Enemies on the Board
Once you have determined what Types of Enemies are
taking part in the Fight, and how many there are of each
Type, it is time to place them on the board. Enemies from an
Attack Exploration Token are placed on the Map Tile where
the Token was revealed.  
Enemies are placed on the board in reverse
order of Initiative, from lowest to highest. So
the slowest Enemies are always at the back of
the group.  
Starting with the lowest Initiative Enemy Type, models
are placed on the Map Tile in every other space, forming a
checkerboard pattern starting in the row farthest from the Map
Tile Entrance, all the way to the back left (as shown in the
diagram below). This includes any puzzle connection halfspaces.  
Once all of an Enemy Type has been placed, continue
on to the next lowest Initiative Enemy Type, until all Enemies
have been placed on the board. If more than one Enemy
Type shares the same Initiative, roll randomly between them
for which is placed first.  
Skip over any spaces that are not valid map spaces (less
than 50% of a space) as well as any spaces that already have
a model in it.  

### Placing Enemy Example
Since this is a text only example with no visual diagrams, let's imagine a Map Tile on the table with each space number and display as below as columns and rows:  
```
      |01|02|  
      |03|04|05|06|  
|07|08|09|10|11|12|  
|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|  
   |20|21|22|23|24|25|  
         |26|27|  
         |28|29|  
```
The Map Tile entrance spaces in the above map would be spaces 28 and 29. 
If you had to play 2 Temple Guard (Initiative 3) and 6 Serpentmen Archers (Initiative 6), the Temple Guard would be placed first, starting on the opposide side of the Map Tile entrance spaces. Once all Enemy models were placed they would be located as follows:
- Temple Guard: 01, 04
- Serpentmen Archers: 06, 07, 09, 11, 14, 16

If there are more Enemy models to place than will fit in
the checkerboard pattern on the Map Tile, return to the back
row and begin placing models to fill in the spaces between.  
If there are more models than will fit on the Map Tile,
even with every space filled (which is rather rare), overflow
models should be placed onto the Map Tile connected to
the Entrance of the Room (most likely filling in around the
Heroes) until they have all been placed.

### Not Enough Models
If you are called on to place more Enemies of a particular
Enemy Type than you have models available (for instance, you
must place 2 Temple Guard, but you only have 1 model as the
rest are already on the board), place all of the models that you
do have available, and ALL Enemies of that Type gain a free
Elite ability for the duration of this Fight.  

### Elite Enemies
Sometimes the Heroes will encounter a particularly nasty
group of Enemies that are stronger, tougher, or more dangerous
than normal. This is represented by Enemies having one or
more Elite abilities.  
When a group of Enemies is Elite, you must roll once on
the Elite Chart at the bottom of the Enemy’s Record Sheet to
see what extra ability they have. This Elite ability is applied to
ALL Enemies of that Type for the duration of the Fight (so if
you have 4 Tentacles on the board and 2 more show up that are
Elite, all Tentacles on the board will get the Elite ability rolled).
You may place a marker or die on the Enemy Record Sheet to
keep track of which Ability they have gained (1-6).  
It is possible, especially as Heroes gain experience and go
up in Hero Level, that a group of Enemies may have more
than one Elite ability (double Elite or even triple Elite, etc).
This just means that you must roll multiple times on the Elite
Chart to see what abilities those Enemies have. If the same
Elite ability is rolled more than once, Re-roll (unless noted
otherwise in the text of that Ability).  
There is a bonus to fighting Elite Enemies, however, in
that Elite Enemies are worth +5 XP for each Elite Ability they
have.  

## Ambush Attacks
Sometimes an Enemy Attack will be listed as an Ambush
Attack. This means that the Enemies have surprised the
Heroes and are able to spring from the shadows to attack.  
In an Ambush Attack, instead of being placed in the
standard checkerboard pattern at the back of a room, Enemies
are placed directly adjacent to the Heroes! If there are different
Initiatives with the Enemies being placed in an Ambush Attack,
the Enemies with the highest Initiative are placed first (so that
the faster Enemies have priority on selecting targets).  
Ambushing Enemies are placed adjacent to
the Heroes and gain +2 Initiative during the first
turn of the Fight.  
If a new group of Enemies is placed by Ambush while a
Fight is already going on, the new Enemies get the +2 Initiative
during the first turn of the Fight they are involved in, as do any
other Enemies already in the Fight that are the same specific
Type as the Ambushers (Tentacles, Drowned Dead, etc).  

### Enemy Placement
To determine exactly where the Ambushing Enemies are
placed, start with the highest Initiative group of Enemies and
place one model in any space adjacent to a Random Hero.
That Enemy is said to be targeting that Hero to attack.  
The next Enemy model is placed in any space adjacent
to a Random Hero with the least number of Enemies of that
Type targeting it and has at least one open space adjacent to
it. In this way, the Enemies are placed to be evenly spread,
targeting all of the different Heroes (though some Heroes will
likely have more Enemies placed adjacent to them than others,
due to limited open spaces). This process continues until all of
the Ambushing Enemies are placed targeting Heroes.  
Any Enemies that cannot be placed adjacent to a Hero,
due to lack of open spaces, are placed as close to the Heroes
as possible. These Enemies are not considered to be targeting
any specific Hero, yet.  

### Enemies Appearing Mid-Turn
On rare occasion, a new group of Enemies will Ambush
Attack during the Models Activate in Initiative Order portion of
the turn, usually by way of a Hero Scavenging and finding a
Darkness card. When this happens, the Enemies are placed
and the current turn immediately ends! A brand new turn
begins, starting the Fight. Note that this is not the case if
Enemies Ambush during the Hold Back the Darkness phase, as
the Activating of models has not yet started.  

## Turns During a Fight
Turns work much the same during a Fight as they do
when Enemies are not on the board, the main difference is
that the Enemies get to Activate as well as the Heroes. Also,
the Heroes will actually be attacking during their Activation,
instead of just moving and exploring.  

Enemies get to Activate first if their Initiative
is tied with a Hero.  

All Enemies of a specific Type (such as Tentacles or Temple
Guard) are Activated at the same time, as a group. If more
than one Enemy Type have the same Initiative, roll randomly
between them each turn to see which gets to Activate first.  
When a Type of Enemies is Activated, they will get to
Move and Attack just like a Hero would; they just get to do so
as a group. This is covered in detail below.  

### Fear, Terror, and Unspeakable Terror
Some especially scary creatures will cause Horror Hits
on Heroes just for being near them! These Enemies have an
Ability called Fear (x), Terror (x), or Unspeakable Terror
(x), and are defined on the Enemy’s Record Sheet.  
Fear does Horror Hits to adjacent Heroes, Terror does
Horror Hits to Heroes that are on the same Map Tile as it,
and Unspeakable Terror does Horror Hits if the Hero is on the
same or even adjacent Map Tile to the creature. The (x) is the
number of Horror Hits done.  
These abilities can be very effective at reducing a Hero’s
Sanity, as they stack up for each Enemy that causes them, and
they do the Horror Hits every turn as long as the Enemy is
alive.  
Note that Horror Hits only do 1 Sanity Damage each
unless specifically noted as doing more on the card or ability.  

### Hero Movement During a Fight
Heroes move normally during a Fight, with one exception.
If a Hero ever has an Enemy in an adjacent space to them,
the Hero must first try to Escape before starting or continuing
to move.

**Escape Tests**  
Every Enemy has an Escape value listed on their Record
Sheet. When a Hero is adjacent to that Enemy and wants to
move, they must first roll an Escape Test.  
To make an Escape Test, roll a D6. If the result is equal
to or higher than the Enemy’s Escape value, the test is passed
and the Hero may move for the rest of this turn ignoring any
adjacent Enemies that have that Escape value or lower.  
For example, if a Hero is adjacent to an Enemy with a 4+
Escape value, they must roll a 4, 5, or 6 on a D6 to be able to move.
Once they do, however, for the rest of the turn, that Hero may move
past any adjacent Enemy with an Escape value of 4+, 3+, or 2+.  
If the Hero becomes adjacent to another Enemy with a
higher Escape value (ie - 5+ or 6+ in the previous example),
they must stop their move and make a new Escape Test with
the higher difficulty to keep going.  

**No Searching or Room Exploration**  
As noted in the section on Hero Movement, Searching
and Room Exploration may not be done during a Fight (this
includes Scavenging as the Heroes are a little busy).  

### Hero Attacks
After a Hero has moved, they are allowed to make one
Attack. This can be a Melee Attack using their basic Combat
value, or a Ranged Attack using a Ranged Weapon like a
Crossbow or Gun.  

**Melee Attacks**  
Every Hero has a built-in Melee Attack available to them
in the form of their Combat value. This represents the Hero
punching, kicking, or using simple improvised weapons. A
Melee Attack uses the Hero’s basic Combat value, which is
usually 2, as well as any bonuses they may have from Items or
Abilities. A Melee Attack may only target adjacent Enemies,
so you will need to get up close to use it.  

A Hero’s Combat value is the number of dice
they get to roll when making a Melee Attack.  

A Hero can use any number of Items and Abilities they
have to add bonuses to their Melee Attack as long as they
observe all relevant restrictions (such as having no more than
2 {One Handed} worth of Items equipped, etc).  

**Ranged Attacks**  
Ranged Attacks are provided by a Ranged Weapon the
Hero has, such as a Bow or Gun. These Items are listed as
having a Range as well as a number of Shots.  
Range is the number of spaces away that an Enemy can
be and still be hit by the Attack.  
Shots is the number of dice the Hero gets to roll for a
Ranged Attack made with that Weapon.  

**Roll 'To Hit'**  
Every Hero has two different ‘To Hit’ values listed on
their Character Sheet - Melee To Hit and Ranged To Hit. Melee
To Hit is used when making a Melee Attack and Ranged To
Hit is used when making a Ranged Attack.  
The Hero rolls their dice and each roll that is equal to or greater than their appropriate ‘To Hit’ value counts as one Hit.
Any dice that rolled a 6+ counts as a Critical Hit and gets a
special bonus when rolling for Damage.  

**Assigning Hits**  
After all of the Hero’s dice have been rolled and the
number of Hits determined, the Hero is allowed to assign
those Hits, one at a time, to any Enemies within Range.  

Hits may always be assigned and resolved
one at a time, or in groups. It is your choice.  

For Melee Attacks, Hits may only be assigned to adjacent
Enemies.  

For Ranged Attacks, Hits may be assigned to any Enemies
within the Range of the Weapon and within the Hero’s Line
of Sight. However...  

If there are Enemies adjacent to you, you
must always assign and resolve Ranged Hits
against them first.  

If your initial Hits kill all Enemies adjacent to you, you
may then begin assigning subsequent Ranged Hits to other
Enemies.  

### Line of Sight
To be able to see an Enemy and assign Hits to them,
you must be able to draw a straight line from the center of
the Hero’s space to the center of the target’s space without
it crossing a Wall (the thick black border of the Map Tiles).
Only Walls block Line of Sight; other models have no effect
on it.  

### Line of Sight Example
Since this is a text only example with no visual diagrams, let's imagine a Map Tile on the table with each space number and display as below as columns and rows:  
```
         |11|12|
|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|  
   |20|21|22|23|24|25|  
         |26|27|  
         |28|29|  
```

In addition to the layout of the map tile diagram above:  
  - The Hero is in space 28.
  - Enemy A is on space 18.
  - Enemy B is on space 25.
  - The northeast corner of space 17 is blocked by a wall.
  - The southeast corner of space 23 is blocked by a wall.

In this example, the Hero would have Line of Sight to Enemy A but line of sight to Enemy B would be blocked.  

### Rolling for Damage
Each successful Hit that the Hero scored on an Enemy
does D6 Damage to that Enemy. These Damage rolls are
made separately for each Hit (though all Damage rolls for Hits
assigned to a single target may be rolled together so that the
Hero may use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of them).  

### Enemy Defense
Enemy Defense works a little bit differently than Hero
Defense. Instead of being a saving roll that
the Enemy gets (which would be a little
cumbersome), an Enemy’s Defense value is
simply subtracted from the Damage that each
incoming Hero Hit would do. The remaining
Damage after Defense is the number of
Wounds actually done to that Enemy.  
So, for example, if a Hero scores 2 Hits and rolls a 3 and a 5 for
Damage, an Enemy with Defense 3 would take a total of 2 Wounds
(Damage 3 - Defense 3 =0 and Damage 5 - Defense 3 =2).  

### Critical Hits
As noted above, any Hero To Hit rolls of 6+ count as
Critical Hits! These special Hits allow you to ignore an
Enemy’s Defense and apply all of the Damage that Hit does
directly to the Enemy’s Health. This can be very powerful,
allowing you to wound or kill an Enemy, even if it has a fairly
high Defense value.  

### Wounding and Killing an Enemy
When a Hero does one or more Wounds to an Enemy,
Wound markers should be placed by that Enemy model to
track how much damage it has taken. These Wounds stay on
that Enemy until it is killed.  
An Enemy is killed as soon as it has a number of Wounds
equal to its Health. When an Enemy is killed, it is immediately
removed from the board and the Hero that caused the last
Wound gains XP.  

### Enemies with Armor
Some Enemies have an ability that gives them Armor (Note
that the ‘Armor’ ability is different from normal ‘Defense’).
Applying damage to an Enemy with Armor requires an extra
step. After you have determined how much Damage a Hit has
done to the Enemy, and subtracted the Enemy’s Defense value,
you must then roll an extra D6 for each individual Wound you
are about to cause. For each roll that is equal to or higher than
the Enemy’s Armor value, that Wound is prevented.  
For example, a Hero does 2 Hits to an Enemy model that has
Defense 4 and Armor 5+. The Damage rolls for those 2 Hits are 5
and 6. This would normally cause 3 Wounds total to the Enemy (5 -
Defense 4 = 1 Damage, and 6 - Defense 4 = 2 Damage, for a total
of 3 Damage). But before the Damage is applied, the player must
roll 3 dice for the Enemy’s Armor (one for each individual point of
Damage). For each roll of 5 or 6 (Armor 5+), that individual Wound
is prevented by the Armor.  

### Collecting XP
Every Enemy has an XP value listed on its Record Sheet,
just below its Health. For smaller Enemies, this XP value is
the amount of XP gained by a Hero that kills it (causes the last
Wound which removes it from the board).  
For larger Enemies, this XP value works a bit differently
and is marked as a Base number of XP ‘+5 Each’. For these
larger Enemies, Heroes gain XP just for Wounding them. This
allows all of the Heroes to get XP for doing their part in helping to take down a larger creature.  
During a Hero’s Attack, the Base XP is gained once if the
Hero does any Wounds at all to the Enemy model, and the ‘+5
Each’ is gained for each Wound done to that Enemy model
across all of the Hero’s Hits during the Attack.  
For example, if a Hero scores 2 Hits on a large Enemy with
‘10XP +5 Each’ as its XP value, and those Hits do 2 Wounds and 4
Wounds after the Enemy’s Defense, the Hero would gain a total of
40 XP (10 XP for Wounding the target as well as +5 XP for each of
the six Wounds actually caused: 10+30 = 40 XP).  
As noted earlier, Elite Enemies are worth +5 XP per Elite
ability they have. This is only added to the base XP value for
larger Enemies that give XP per Wound.  

### Free Attacks
Some cards and abilities give
a Hero a Free Attack. A Free
Attack is a special type of Attack
that a Hero may use during their
Activation, and is in addition
to their normal Attack. It can
be made either before or after
making a normal Attack.  

No more than 1 Free
Attack may be made by a
Hero in a single turn.  

A Free Attack is Exhausted when used
(unless discarded)and lists in ( ) how often it may be used
(that is, when the player may Ready the Item or Ability that
grants the Free Attack). This is usually Once per Fight or Once
per Adventure.  
Free Attacks are always listed as either a Ranged Attack
or Melee Attack.  
Ranged Free Attacks have a Range as well as number of
Shots used for the Attack.  
Melee Free Attacks have a listed Combat value that is
used instead of the Hero’s Combat value. They do NOT gain
any Combat bonuses or modifiers that would normally affect
the Hero’s Melee Attacks, such as those granted by other Hand
Weapons that are equipped.  

### Throwing a Bomb or Dynamite
A Hero may throw a Bomb or Dynamite Token as a
Ranged Attack. The Range of the throw is up
to the Hero’s Strength +3 and it may be thrown
at ANY space in Range as long as the Hero has
Line of Sight to that space (even if
Enemies are adjacent to the Hero).  
Roll once To Hit. If successful,
the Bomb lands in the targeted space
and explodes. If the To Hit roll was
missed, the Bomb will instead Bounce
D3 times in Random Directions before
exploding. Use the D8 to determine
the direction of each space the Bomb
Bounces into.  
When the Bomb explodes, it does
D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense, to each model in the same
and adjacent spaces to it. Roll the Damage for each model
separately.  

Since the Bounce Diagram image for Bombs and Dynamite cannot be shown, the direction of a Bounce using a D8 can be easily mapped to cardinal directions in a text description. The direction of each Bounce according to each possible D8 result is:  
1. NW
2. N
3. NE
4. E
5. SE
6. S
7. SW
8. W

## Enemy Movement
When a Type of Enemy is Activated, they get to Move and
then Attack as a group.  

### Activating an Enemy Type
As discussed above, all of the Enemies of a specific Type
are Activated together when their Initiative comes up in the
turn order. When Activated, the first thing that the Enemies do
is to Target Heroes and move towards them to Attack.  

### Targeting Heroes and Movement
Though all of the Enemies of a specific Type are Activated
together, they choose their targets and move one at a time,
starting with the Enemy model that is closest to the Heroes. If
more than one are at equal distance to the nearest Hero, you
may choose the order that they are moved in.  
The first Enemy model targets a Random Hero that they
can reach - within their Move distance (printed on the Enemy
Record Sheet) and with a clear path to get there. That Enemy
is said to be targeting the selected Hero to Attack and is moved
as far as it can be to a space adjacent to that Hero. This will
usually have the Enemy move to the far side of the Hero,
getting in behind them and making way for other Enemies.  
It is often a good idea to have the Enemy models physically
turned to face the Hero they are targeting so that it is very clear
where each Enemy is placing its Attacks.  
Then, the next closest Enemy model will target a different
Random Hero with the least number of Enemies of that Type
targeting it and is within reach. In this way, the Enemies are
moved to be evenly spread, targeting all of the different Heroes
(though some Heroes will likely have more Enemies reach
them than others, due to paths being blocked or not enough
movement). This process continues until all of the Activating
Enemies have been moved.  
Any Enemies that cannot reach a Hero will move as far
as they can toward the nearest Hero. These Enemies are not
considered to be targeting any specific Hero yet.  

### Staying on Target
Once an Enemy targets a Hero, it will continue to target
and attack that Hero until they are KO’d or until the Hero is
no longer adjacent. Enemies do NOT change target based on
who is attacking them.  

### Choosing a New Target
If the Hero being targeted by an Enemy moves away or is
KO’d, at the start of the Enemy’s next Activation it will select a
new Hero using the same process described above.  
In this way, if a Hero is feeling overwhelmed, they can
always try to Escape and run away in the hopes that the
Enemies targeting them will choose a new and different target
during their next Activation.  

### Large Enemies
Large Size Enemies have a special built-in ability to brush
aside and push past smaller Enemies to reach the Heroes.
Whenever a Large Size Enemy (or bigger) is selecting a
target Hero, they may move through other Enemies that are
Medium or Small Size that would normally block their path.
As the Large Enemy moves, it may enter a Medium/Small
Enemy’s space, displacing that smaller Enemy into the space
that the Large Enemy just left. In this way, the Large Enemy
swaps places with the smaller one to push past it and get closer
to the Hero.  
Large Enemies may displace any number of Small/
Medium Enemies like this during their move to reach their
target Hero. They may not, however, displace other Large
Size Enemies or Heroes to reach their target.  

## Enemy Attacks
Once all of the currently Activating Enemies have targeted
a Hero and been moved, it is time for each of them to Attack!  

### Rolling 'To Hit'
Rolling To Hit for Enemy Attacks works just like it does
for a Hero Attack. The only difference is that Enemies DO
NOT get Critical Hits on rolls of 6+. Some Enemies do,
however, have special Abilities which might be triggered by
To Hit rolls of 6+ (such as Tentacles with their Smash Ability).  
Each Enemy rolls a number of dice equal to their Combat
value against the Hero it is targeting. Every die that successfully
rolls equal to or greater than the Enemy’s ‘To Hit’ value causes
one Hit on the Hero.  
Note that as the game itself is playing the Enemies, it is
up to other players to actually roll the dice for the Enemies’
Attacks. A player should not roll the Enemy Attacks on their
own Hero (that would be bad form). Instead, one of the other
players should roll the dice for the Enemy Attacks against you.
It is usually good to simply always roll the Enemy Attacks
against the player to your left, or to just exchange (“I’ll roll the
Enemy Attacks on you and you roll the Attacks against me”).  
As a general rule, all of the Attacks on a Hero from
models in the current Enemy Group should be rolled at the
same time (as one big group of dice).  

### Hero Defense Rolls
For each Hit a Hero takes, they must make a Defense roll
to attempt to block it.  
If Attacked by multiple models from the same Enemy
Group, it is recommended that the Hero rolls all of their
Defense dice at the same time (to speed up game play and
allowing you to Re-roll all of your missed Defense rolls for
those Attacks with a single Grit).  

### Taking Damage
For each Hit that the Hero failed to block with their
Defense, they take a number of Wounds equal to the Enemy’s
Damage value.  

## Completing a Fight
Once all of the Enemies on the board have been defeated,
the Fight immediately ends and it is time for the Heroes to
Catch Your Breath, Recover from being KO’d, and collect Loot
for the Fight.  

This immediately ends the current turn, as
well as the Fight itself.  

### Catching Your Breath
Each Hero is allowed to Catch Your Breath at the end of
every Fight, Healing D3 Wounds/Sanity (any mix).  
If the Fight ended before a Hero got to Activate, or take
any Actions, that Hero instead gets to Heal D6 Wounds/
Sanity (any mix) or Recover 1 Grit. This is an extra bonus for
each Hero that didn’t get an Activation in the last Fight round.  

### Recovering From Being KO'd
Any Hero that was KO’d during the Fight now gets to
Recover, placing their figure back on the board and Healing 2D6 Wounds/Sanity (any
mix) They do, however, also need to roll
once on the Injury Chart or Madness Chart
(Injury if their Health was reduced to 0,
Madness if their Sanity was reduced to 0). This represents
any long-lasting effects of being KO’d.  
In the event that both a Hero’s Health and Sanity were
reduced to 0 at the same time, they must roll an Injury and a
Madness, but they are allowed to Heal 2D6 Health and 2D6
Sanity.  

### Drawing Loot Cards
After a Fight, the Heroes get Loot for their hard work.  

At the end of a Fight, every Hero is allowed
to draw one Loot card for each Threat card that
added Enemies to the Fight (to a max of 3 Loot
Cards each).  

This also includes each instance of Enemies that were
added to the Fight by other means, such as a Darkness or
Encounter card, or the Depth Event chart.  
The Loot Deck has no discard pile and should be fully
shuffled before the Heroes draw one or more cards from it.
All of the Heroes draw from the Loot Deck at the same time.
If there are not enough Loot cards to cover all of those that
need to be drawn by the Heroes, the Loot Deck would need to
be shuffled before the remaining Heroes could finish drawing.  

### Dark Stone and Gold
Dark Stone and Gold are
the two main currencies of
the game and are the most
common reward that can be
found in the Loot Deck.  
Gold represents a mixture
of coins and raw ore that can
be found on an Adventure.
The Gold prices listed on Items
are meant to reflect the abstract
nature of having a generalized
‘money’ currency and the overinflated
economy of a region
engulfed in chaos, where equipment is in
short supply.  
Gold is really only used when keeping Heroes from
game to game and can be spent when visiting Camp between
Adventures. Dark Stone is mainly used for the Campaign
game as well, for forging Items and Upgrades in Camp,
though several Items and abilities are fueled by Dark Stone
even during an Adventure.  

## Enemy Behavior Special Rules

### Shootout
Models with Shootout will generally
attempt to stay back, away from the
Heroes, and attack them from a distance.
The rules for Shootout are summarized on
the Shootout Reference card, but are also covered
here in greater detail. 

**Ambushing**  
When a group of Enemies with the
Shootout Standard Ability needs to be placed
in Ambush, they are not placed adjacent to
the Heroes like other Enemies. Instead, select
a Random Hero and place all of the Shootout Enemies from
that group on the selected Hero’s Map Tile, as far from any
Heroes as possible. This usually allows them to sneak in from
a side passage or get placed at the end of a hall or room,
maybe even behind the Heroes. If there are not enough empty
spaces on that Map Tile, any remaining Enemies are placed as
far from the Heroes as possible on any Map Tiles adjacent to
the selected Hero.  

**Retreating**  
When an Enemy with Shootout starts its Activation
adjacent to one or more Heroes, it will usually try to move
away. Roll a D6 for the Enemy model. On the roll of 4, 5,
or 6, the Enemy immediately makes a Free Move along the
shortest distance to no longer be adjacent to any Heroes. This
Free Move is outside of the Enemy’s normal Move and does
not count against its Movement allowance for the turn.  

**Melee Attacks**  
Any Shootout Enemy that failed to Retreat (or was stuck
adjacent to a Hero, and could not move away), will make a
normal Combat Attack against a Random adjacent Hero this
turn, instead of their Ranged Attack.  

**Shootout Markers**  
hootout markers are used to denote which
Heroes have been targeted, and by how many
Enemy Ranged Attacks. Any suitable markers can
be used for this. Shootout markers are a simple
way to keep track of which Heroes have already been
targeted, and by how many of the Enemies.  

**Targeting**  
After any Retreat moves, the Shootout Enemies that
are not adjacent to a Hero, will each find a Target for their
Ranged Attacks. Step through the Shootout Enemies, one by
one, completing the following procedure for each of them.  
Select a Random Hero that does not have a Shootout
marker on him yet (or that has the fewest Shootout markers
if all Heroes already have one) and move the shortest distance
to get within Range and Line Of Sight to that Target. The
Enemy may not end its Move adjacent to any Heroes. The
Enemy MAY move through other Enemies from its group
during this movement, as they make way for one another.  
At the end of this Move, if the selected Target is within
Range and Line Of Sight, place a Shootout marker on that
Target. If not, select a new Random Hero that is currently
within Range and Line Of Sight to the Enemy (prioritizing
those with the fewest Shootout markers) and place a Shootout
marker on him instead.  
Then proceed to the next Enemy in the group.  

**Making Ranged Attacks**  
Once all of the Enemy Group has moved and
placed their Shootout markers, roll Ranged Attacks
from the Enemies against each Hero equal to
the number of Shootout markers on that Hero.
Then, remove all of the Shootout markers.  

## Advanced Rules
The following are Advanced Rules that are meant to be integrated into the game after you are comfortable with the basics
and want to add in the rest of the game features. These mainly include the Epic Threat boss enemies, the Campaign system of
keeping Heroes from game to game, and stepping through gateways to OtherWorlds!  

### Epic Threats
Epic Threat cards represent much larger
and deadlier boss Enemies that are rare to
come across and hard to defeat. These are
most often used only for final Objective
Room fights as noted in the details of each
individual Mission.  

**1 or 2 Heroes**  
With Hero Parties of only 1 or 2
Heroes, anytime an Epic Threat would be
needed, draw a High Threat card instead. Fighting the
massive boss Enemies often found on Epic Threats can be
overly difficult for only 1 or 2 characters to handle. Of course,
if you are ambitious, you can use Epic Threats anyway, but
you have been warned!  

## Status Effect Markers
Sometimes an Encounter or Enemy Attack will continue
to affect a Hero for some time after the initial event. These
effects are represented by Status Effect markers which are
placed on a Hero and have on ongoing effect.  

### Poison
Poison is a deadly and long lasting effect that can wear a
Hero down over time. A Hero may gain 1 or more
Poison markers from Encounters, Enemy attacks, or
even environmental effects; such as moving through
a cloud of toxic gas.  
Every turn in which a Hero has one or
more Poison markers on them at the start of their
Activation, they must roll a D6 for each Poison marker
they currently have. On the roll of 1 or 2, the Hero takes 1
Wound, ignoring Defense (as well as any Armor/Shield). On
the roll of 3, 4, or 5, there is no effect for that marker. On the
roll of 6, the Poison has worn off and the marker is discarded.
If a Hero is KO’d (or at the end of the Adventure), all Poison
markers on them are automatically removed.  

### Bleeding
Bleeding markers represent deep wounds or particularly
nasty burns by acid or steam. For each Bleeding marker
a model has, it is -3 Health. Note that because this
is a negative modifier to the model’s actual Health
value, it cannot be Healed like Wounds.  
A Hero may
spend a Grit at any
time to remove a
Bleeding marker (note
that Ambition may
NOT be used for
this).  

## Immobile Enemies
Though not very common, some Enemies have an Ability
that makes them Immobile, meaning that they cannot move.
Immobile Enemies usually will either have a Ranged Attack
to use against the Heroes, or be a Spawner, generating new
Enemies for the Heroes to fight until the Spawner can be
destroyed.  

### Ambush with Immobile Enemies
When placing Immobile Enemies during an Ambush
Attack, roll a Random Hero’s Map Tile and place the Immobile
Enemies on that Map Tile in spaces that are as far from any
Heroes as possible (not in the standard Checkerboard fashion).
It is assumed that they were already there and that the Heroes
did not see them until it’s too late.  
Ambushing Immobile Enemies should be placed before
any other Enemies.  

### Escaping From Immobile Enemies
While Immobile Enemies are the only Enemies on the
board, Heroes may Explore (Look Through Doors and
Scavenge) during the Fight. At the start of any turn, remove
any Immobile Enemies from the board that are not within 18
spaces of a Hero. These Enemies do not count as having been
defeated and no XP or Loot card is gained from them.  
In this way, the Heroes may decide to escape from
Immobile Enemies rather than stay to fight them.  
Note that, because many Immobile Enemies are Spawners,
as soon as an Enemy model is Spawned onto the board that
is not Immobile, the Heroes lose the option to Explore and
escape like this until that new Enemy model is defeated.  

## Immune To...
Sometimes a model will be Immune to a certain type of
Damage, Critical Hits, or even particular types of Status Effect
markers.  

### Immune to <Keyword>
If a model is Immune to a certain Keyword (such as Fire
or Weather), that means that the model may ignore all of the
effects and Damage from any Source that is using an ability or
Item with that Keyword.  

### Immune to Critical Hits
Some Enemies have the Tough ability, making them
Immune to Critical Hits. For these models, Critical
Hits from a Hero do not ignore the Enemy’s Defense,
though any other special bonuses triggered for rolling a
Critical Hit may still take effect.  

### Immunity and Status Effect Markers
If a model is Immune to a certain type of Status Effect
marker, that means that markers of that type are never placed
on that model.  

## Extra Large Enemies
Some Enemies are so large and menacing that they take
up multiple spaces on the game board! These are usually boss
creatures and are part of an Epic Threat Fight.  

### Extra Large Base Size
Extra Large Size Enemies actually take up four spaces on
the board in a 2x2 square. When one of these Enemies is being
placed on the board, it uses a single one of its four spaces as
the anchor space for placement and should be positioned so
that the rest of the base is placed into spaces that are viable and
have no other models in them.  

### Movement
When moving, once again the Enemy uses a single one of
its four spaces as an anchor space for counting movement and
distance to a Hero.  
Just like Large Size Enemies, an Extra Large Enemy may
brush aside and push past any Small or Medium Size Enemies
in its way, swapping spaces with them as it goes (it just usually
moves them two spaces back, instead of one, to account for its
larger base size).  

### Overflowing the Board
In some cases, the only way for an Extra Large Enemy
to reach a Hero is to smash through the walls to get to them.
This is called Overflowing the Board and allows the Enemy to
hang off the edge of the Map Tiles to fit into a smaller space
than their base would normally allow. The Enemy must keep
at least half of its base on the board at the end of its move.  

### Area Effect and Extra Large Bases
Even though an Extra Large Enemy takes up multiple
spaces on the board, they are only ever affected once by
weapons and abilities that target an area (like a Bomb for
instance). Even if the explosion would cover two or more
spaces that the Enemy base is in, the Enemy is still only
affected by it once.  

## Enemy Ranged Attacks
Some Enemies have Abilities that give them a Ranged
Attack to battle the Heroes with.  

### Targeting Heroes and Movement
Enemies with a Ranged Attack will target a Hero as
normal, however they will use the Range of their Ranged
Attack, rather than their Move value, to choose their targets.
This means that they will target a Random Hero based on the
Range of their Attack and Line of Sight rather than on their
Move and a clear Path, like a normal Enemy would. If there
are one or more Heroes adjacent to the Enemy, it will attempt
to target those Heroes first.  
Another aspect of this is that Enemies with a Ranged
Attack will re-target each turn instead of staying with a single
target that they keep attacking.  
These Enemies will generally not Move unless there are
no viable Hero targets for them to Attack. When this is the
case, the Enemy will move toward the nearest Hero until they
are in Range and Line of Sight, then select a target.  

### Ranged or Melee
value, it will only make a Melee Attack if there is an adjacent
Hero to it (the Enemy will not move to make a Melee Attack).
When choosing a target each turn, the Enemy will first select
a Random target from any adjacent Heroes, and if there are
none, it will then select a target at Range.  

### Extra Ranged Attacks
Some Enemies have a Ranged Attack as part of a special
ability that they perform in addition to their normal Melee
Attack (usually at the beginning of their Activation or at the
end of their move). These extra Ranged Attacks do not change
the Enemy’s normal behavior and do not effect how the Enemy
Targets and moves to make its normal Melee Attack.  

## Helping a KO'd Hero
When a Hero gets KO’d during a Fight, it can often be
a slippery slope to defeat for the rest of the party. There are
some ways though that the other Heroes can try to help the
fallen get back into the fight!  

### Recovering a KO'd Hero mid-Fight
A Hero that is adjacent to a KO’d Hero marker may give
up their Attack to help that Hero Recover. This may only be
done as long as there are no Enemies on the same Map Tile
as the KO’d Hero marker. The KO’d Hero immediately rolls
on the Injury/Madness chart as appropriate and Heals their
2D6 Wounds/Sanity (any mix) as normal. Their figure is
placed back onto the board, but they do not get an Activation
in the same turn that they Recover (they are still a bit dazed).  

### Dragging a KO'd Hero
Any Hero in the same or adjacent space to a KO’d Hero
marker may drag that Hero with them while they move. To
do so, simply use 1 extra movement point for each space you
want to move while dragging the KO’d Hero (so 2 move per
space).  
The KO’d Hero marker will be moved along with you as
you go and left in your space (if you started dragging them
while in the space with the marker), or the last space you
moved from if you were adjacent to them. This can be useful
for getting a KO’d Hero to the safety of a Map Tile with no
Enemies so that you can try to help them Recover.  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone can be played Solo or expanded to
support up to 5 or 6 Heroes.  

### A 5 or 6 Hero Game
A 5 or 6 Player game can be achieved by getting a second
Core/Adventure Set or additional Hero Classes to play as.
This works the same as all of the rules detailed so far, and the
difficulty scaling is already listed for the higher player count on
page 11. It is not recommended that you try playing with more
than 6 Heroes as the difficulty scaling does not work very well
with that many Heroes, and the game will start to drag with
so many players.  

### Solo Game
The game can easily be played Solo and is fun whether
controlling a single Hero or a full party of your own! One
Hero makes for an exciting, albeit deadly, game. This method
makes use of the Revive Tokens to keep you going and can be
looked at almost as extra lives. Does your Hero have what it
takes to go it alone?  

### Multiple Heroes of the Same Class
Multiple Heroes of the Same Class
One thing that can be very fun is to play a Hero Party
with more than one of the same Hero Class/Sub-Class, or
even a Party where all of the Heroes are the same Hero Class.
Having a Party of Duelists fence their way through every battle
or a group of Explorers setting out on a mission to locate a
lost relic can create a lot of cool gameplay and story moments!  

### Hero Attack Dice Limit
There is a limit on the number of dice a Hero may roll
for a single Attack. This is called a Hero’s Attack Dice Limit.
Heroes have an Attack Dice Limit of 8, which means:  

A Hero may not roll more than 8 Combat or
8 Shots for a single Attack.  

This includes extra Combat or Shots gained during the
Attack, through Abilities and Items.  
Abilities that let a Hero do a number of Combat/Shots to
specific Enemies (such as ‘all Enemies adjacent’, etc) do not
count against the Hero’s Attack Dice Limit.  

### Dual Wielding Ranged Weapons
Normally a Hero is only allowed to make a Ranged
Attack with a single Ranged Weapon. However, a Hero that
has two Single-Handed Ranged Weapons may fire both as
a single Ranged Attack! This is called Dual Wielding. (Note
that the term Dual Wielding only applies to using two Ranged
Weapons, NOT for a Melee Attack with 2 Hand Weapons).  

There is a penalty to Dual Wielding though:  
The Attack may NOT get Critical Hits for
either of the two weapons.  

Rolls of 6+ count as normal Hits, though they may still
trigger special abilities or effects.  
In addition, the Hero must choose one of the Ranged
Weapons as being fired with their primary hand. The other
Ranged Weapon is considered to be in the Hero’s Off-Hand.  
Dice rolled for Off-Hand Ranged Weapons
need to roll 1 higher than normal on To Hit rolls.  
So shots that would normally need a 4+ To Hit would
need to roll 5+ with an Off-Hand Weapon. Natural To Hit rolls
of 6+ may still trigger special effects.  
It is a good idea to roll two different colors of dice for a
Dual Wielding Ranged Attack, where different colors of dice
are used for the Shots from each weapon.  

## Gates to Another World
Finding a Gateway to another World can be a very
exciting and dangerous event. This usually happens through
an Exploration Token with a Gate Icon or an Encounter that
adds a Gate to a Room.  

### Gate Icons
Gate Icons on Exploration Tokens work
just like Door Icons, but instead of leaving
the puzzle connection open, a Gate End Cap
is placed there.  

### Gate End Caps
Gate End Caps work very similar to Doors. Rather than
standing in one of the puzzle connection half-spaces to look
through the Doorway though, the Hero stands in the halfand-
half connection space adjacent to the blue swirling Gate
(half on the Map Tile and Half on the Gate End Cap) to look
through the Gate.  

### Looking Through a Gate
When a Hero looks through a Gate, they are seeing
through the portal and into another World, across space and
time...maybe even into another dimension! The Hero must
draw a World Card to see where the Gate leads.  

### Drawing a World Card
Each World Card
represents a different World
that is available to the Heroes
to explore. The Valley of the
Serpent Kings Set comes with
the Spanish Fort and one
OtherWorld. While in the
Spanish Fort, the Spanish Fort World Card should be face up near the Depth Track to show that it
is a World that Heroes are currently in. When a Hero looks
through an unexplored Gate, they must draw a World Card
randomly from those not currently in play. Because this Set
only includes one OtherWorld, the Swamps of Jargono - Valley
of the Serpent Kings, this will always be the World that you find
on the other side of a Gate.  
The newly drawn World Card should be placed face up on
the table near the Depth Track as well. There should be one
World Card in play for each World that one or more Heroes
is currently in. When there are no Heroes in that World any
longer, the card should be returned to the World Cards Deck.  

### OtherWorld Map Tiles
The OtherWorld Map Tiles are printed on the reverse side
of the Spanish Fort Map Tiles. There is also a full Map Deck
for the OtherWorld that represents each of the Map Tiles for
that World (just like the Spanish Fort Map Deck).  
Once you have determined the OtherWorld that is through
the Gate, you should draw a Map Card for that World and
put it into play. Then place a Gate End Cap for that World
attached to the Entrance of the newly placed OtherWorld Map
Tile. These two Gate End Caps are connected.  

### Break in the Map
To represent the distance through time and space that the
Gate spans, there is a break in the map whenever the Heroes
find a Gate. One side of the map ends in a Gate End Cap and
the other side begins with a connected Gate End Cap. These
two sections of the board do not need to touch and can be
positioned anywhere on the table relative to one another.  

The two spaces on one Gate End Cap are
considered to be adjacent to the two spaces on
the other Gate End Cap.  

### Exploration Tokens on the Other Side
If the Other World Map Tile placed on the far side of the
Gate is a Room, it will get an Exploration Token placed on
it as normal. Unlike finding a Room in the World you are
already in though, the Hero is simply looking through the
Gate, not actually standing on the new Map Tile (the Hero is
standing on their own side of the Map Tile/Gate End Cap, not
on the new Map Tile/Gate End Cap).  
Because of this, the Exploration Token will not be revealed
until a Room Exploration phase in which a Hero is actually on
the Map Tile with it. So a Hero will actually have to step
through the Gate to Explore the Room on the other side.  

### Movement Through a Gate
Because the two spaces on each side of the Gate are
considered to be adjacent to each other, models may move
through the Gate just as though the spaces on either side were
directly next to one another.  

### Seeing/Attacking Through a Gate
This works the same way for Attacking. Because the
spaces on either side are considered adjacent, a model may
Attack through the Gate. So if you are standing on one side of
the Gate, you may target Enemies on the other side.  
Line of Sight for Ranged Attacks, however, may not be
traced through the Gate unless you are standing on the Gate
End Cap itself looking directly through. This means that you
cannot stand back and just shoot across the room into another
World, but you can move up to the Gate and look through to
start taking shots.  

### Adjacent Map Tiles
If the Hero with the Light Source is standing on a Map
Tile with a Gate End Cap, the light will cover the Map Tile on
the other side of the Gate, as it is considered to be an adjacent Map Tile. This works the same for other effects that reach to
adjacent Map Tiles such as Unspeakable Terror, etc.  
An Enemy with Terror will affect Heroes in the two spaces
directly on the other side of that Gate, even though they are
not technically on the same Map Tile.  

### Encounters, Depth Events, and Ambush Attacks with Two Worlds
When an Encounter is drawn, only the Heroes that are
currently in the same World as that Encounter are affected by
its game text and involved with taking the tests on that card.  
Similarly, when an Ambush Attack occurs, the Enemies
will only be placed adjacent to and target Heroes that are in
the same World as the Ambush. If the Ambush was caused by
something that is not located in one World or another (such
as a Darkness card), select a Random Hero and the Ambush
takes place in the same World as that Hero.  
Depth Events are always assumed to take place in the
same World that the Light Source is in and will only affect
Heroes that are in that World with it. Note that each Other
World has its own unique Depth Event Chart to be used when
the Hero with the Light Source is in that World.  

## OtherWorlds
Each OtherWorld is intended to have a distinct look and
feel to it as the Heroes explore and find new, wondrous, and
sometimes deadly things there. This is achieved through
having a unique set of Map Tiles as well as Global Effects for
anyone in that World. There is also a small set of card decks
that are unique to that World. Each Core Set focuses on all of
the details of one of these OtherWorlds (as described in the
Adventure Book). More OtherWorlds can be found in other
Shadows of Brimstone Core Sets and Expansions.  

### World Cards and Global Effects
Every World (including the Spanish Fort) is represented
by a World Card. This World Card lists the Name of the
World as well as any Global Effects that apply to any Heroes
currently in that World.  

### Map Cards, Encounters, Artifacts, and OtherWorld Threats
Each OtherWorld has unique card decks for Map Cards,
Encounters, Artifacts, and OtherWorld Threats. While in
that OtherWorld, these card decks should be used in place of
the normal versions of these decks. When a card would be
drawn from one of these decks, simply use the OtherWorld
version of that deck instead. This is a relatively obvious switch
for each of these decks, with the exception of the OtherWorld
Threats.  
OtherWorld Threat cards represent Enemies that are
unique to the alien world you are in. Unlike the normal
Threat Decks that are split into Low, Med, and High Threats,
there is only one OtherWorld Threat Deck and each card in
it lists the result for Low (Green), Med (Yellow), and High
(Red) Threats. Normal Epic Threats are used for Other Worlds
as well, but any additional Threat cards they have you draw
should be from the OtherWorld Threat cards.  

### Loot Cards for Gear and Artifacts
You will likely have noticed that the Loot cards that allow
a Hero to draw a Gear card or an Artifact card have a special
note on them. While in an OtherWorld, these card effects are
actually reversed, so the Loot card that normally lets you draw
a Gear will give you an Artifact and vice versa. This is because
it is more likely for a Hero to find Gear in an Earth-based
world, while it is more likely to find an Artifact in a strange
alien environment.  

## Conquistador Footmen Allies
Conquistador Footmen Allies are extra fighters that you
can bring along with you on Adventures. These Allies can help
battle Enemies and have special abilities to aid in warding off
the Darkness. Because they are not full-fledged Heroes though,
their abilities and actions are a bit more limited than what a
Player Hero could do. They also are not nearly as tough as
Heroes and are far more likely to succumb to the horrors
encountered along the way. No one ever said the life of a
Conquistador Footmen would be easy.  
Conquistador Footmen Allies may be hired to join the
Hero Party between Adventures during the Camp Stay. The
Gold cost to hire an Ally is listed in the lower right corner of
the medium sized Ally reference sheet. As noted on the card,
Conquistador Footmen may only be hired by a Conquistador
Hero or a Hero that is Keyword Tribal. All of the Heroes in
this set are Conquistadors, but when adding other Expansion
Heroes, this becomes more important.  
Allies come in two varieties - Basic or Advanced.  

### Basic Allies
The Basic version of an Ally is represented
by a token and is more akin to a ‘one use’
item that can be discarded for a unique bonus
during the Adventure. The various uses of a
Basic Conquistador Footman Ally are listed on
the Basic side of the medium Ally reference sheet.
As listed on the sheet, any individual Hero may only have up
to 2 Basic Conquistador Footmen Allies at a time.  

### Advanced Allies
An Advanced Ally is closer to
an actual Hero (though not nearly
as strong). They have a model that
moves around the board and fights
just like a Hero, with their own
special abilities and gear. This also
means that they can be killed in a
Fight, or by the various dangers of
an expedition.  
The stats, abilities, and gear of
an Advanced Conquistador Footman
Ally can be found on the Advanced
side of the medium Ally reference sheet.  
It is important to note that the Hero Party may never have
more than 8 models total on the board, including Heroes and
Allies.  
Advanced Conquistador Footmen Allies are Activated just
like Heroes and should be moved, rolled for, etc by the Hero
Players (most likely by the specific Hero that hired them to
come along on the Adventure).  
An Advanced Conquistador Footman Ally is treated as
a Hero for all purposes, except for the following limitations:  
- May not get Critical Hits on Attacks
- May not carry or equip Items
- May not gain or use Grit or Ambition
- May not draw Loot cards
- May not Explore (Look through Doors
or Scavenge)
- Do not gain normal XP (they use Ally
XP instead)
- Are Targeted by Enemies normally, but
are never included for Skill tests

Once you have hired a Conquistador Footman Ally, they
stay with the Hero Party until killed, or you decide not to bring
them on an Adventure.  

### Ally Upgrades and Mutations
Advanced Conquistador
Footmen Allies do not gain normal
XP during an Adventure. Instead,
they gain 1 Ally XP at the end of
each successful Adventure that they
survive through. For a Conquistador
Footman, each Ally XP earned may be
spent to gain an Upgrade - roll a D6 and
consult the medium size Conquistador
Footmen Upgrade Sheet for details on this. In
this way, Conquistador Footman Allies can gain new abilities
and stat boosts if you can keep them alive long enough from
game to game.  
Similarly, an Advanced Conquistador Footman Ally has
a Corruption Resistance of 2 listed on their sheet. When they
have collected 2 Corruption Points, remove them and roll once
on the Conquistador Footmen Mutation Chart found on the
back of the Upgrade Sheet.  

### Death of an Ally and Camp
When an Advanced Ally is reduced to 0 Health or 0
Sanity, he is not KO’d, but rather killed and removed from the
board. Allies that are killed may NOT use Revive Tokens.  
An Ally that is killed may instead be ‘Revived’ between
Adventures by paying its Cost to Hire again, plus an additional
$200 for each Upgrade it has. This Ally retains all Upgrades
and Mutations.  
Between Adventures, Allies do NOT participate in a
Camp Stay with the Heroes (it is assumed that they have gone
off to tend to their own affairs or are quietly following along
without taking part).  

### Veteran Advanced Allies
As the Heroes advance in Level and begin facing Brutal
Enemies, normal Advanced Allies may be too fragile to be
viable. To account for this, once the Heroes reach Hero Party
Level 5, they now have the option to Hire Veteran Conquistador
Footmen which are double the Gold cost to Hire, but have
double their basic Health and Sanity values.  
If you are familiar with other Allies in Shadows
of Brimstone, you should note that these Conquistador
Footmen Allies work a little bit differently in that they are
very focused combat fighters. They do not have any Ally
Specialties and do NOT count toward the Hero Party
Size for determining Threat Level, etc. They also operate
under somewhat streamlined Ally Rules to make them
easier to use, as detailed above.  

## Campaign Play
Creating new Heroes and playing a single Adventure can
be a lot of fun, but keeping your Hero from game to game and
watching them grow over several missions in a Campaign is
an extremely rewarding process that allows the story and game
world to really shine. This also allows you to build and grow
your Expedition Camp between Adventures, as well as go up
in Hero Levels and get new Abilities and gear as you go!  

### At the End of Each Adventure
When playing a Campaign with your Heroes, at the end
of each Adventure, every Hero must do the following, in order:  
Recover if KO’d (rolling on the Injury/Madness Chart)
- Fully Heal your Health and Sanity
- Remove any Status Effect markers
- Resolve any Reward/Failure results of the Mission
- Roll for Corruption from Dark Stone
- Discard any unused Team Ability Cards
- Re-set your Hero Ability Tokens (Remove all Ambition)
- Re-set your Hero to 1 Grit for the Camp Stay

### Rolling for Dark Stone Corruption
At the end of an Adventure, each Hero must roll a D6
for every Dark Stone they are currently carrying (including
Items with a Dark Stone Icon). For every roll of 1, 2, or 3,
that Hero takes 1 Corruption Hit from the dark influence of
the Dark Stone. Willpower saves may be used to prevent these
Corruption Hits as normal.  

### Setting Up Your Camp/Town Stay
One exciting element of Campaign play is having the
ability for your Heroes to build their Expedition Camp. The
Camp can be visited between each Adventure to re-stock and
re-supply, as well as to spend your resources on powerful new
gear and bonuses by upgrading the Camp over time. Visiting
your Expedition Camp and Upgrading the Camp are covered
in detail in other sections.  

### At the Start of Each Adventure
After completing your Camp Stay, the Heroes will be
ready to start their next Adventure. To do so, the Heroes must
do the following steps, in order:  
- Select the next Mission to be played. If playing through
the Valley of the Serpent Kings Campaign this will usually be
the next Mission in the narrative.
- Re-set your Hero Ability Tokens (Conquistadors
generally start each Adventure with 1 Ambition).
- Re-set your Hero to 1 Grit for the new Adventure
- Note that any Wounds and Sanity Damage taken during
the Camp Stay remain with the Hero for the start of the
next Adventure.
- Draw Team Ability Cards

## Inuries, Madness, and Death
As noted previously, any time a Hero is KO’d during an
Adventure, they must roll on the Injury or Madness chart to
determine how bad off they really are (depending if they were
KO’d by loss of Health or Sanity). The results on these charts
range from getting the wind knocked out of you to being torn
to pieces and killed.  

### Healing Injuries and Madness in Camp
Injuries and Madness can have significant effects on a
Hero’s ability to keep Adventuring. Good news though,
there is a way to try to Heal or remove most of these longlasting
effects by returning to your Expedition Camp between
Adventures and visiting the Anchored Ship or the Camp Fire.  
At the Anchored Ship you can get Surgery to attempt to
repair an Injury or have an unwanted Mutation removed. This
can be somewhat expensive and there is no guarantee that it
will work, but hey, if you want to keep adventuring into the
dark halls of the Spanish Fort with a Broken Leg or a Void
Infection, that’s up to you.  
Much like the Anchored Ship, visiting the Camp Fire allows
you to try to Exorcise Madness that plagues your mind. This
Location also offers ways to remove Corruption before it turns
into a full blown Mutation.  

### Death of a Hero
On rare occasions, a Hero will actually be killed. This is
a harsh reality of being an explorer, especially when you are
fighting off demons and madness at every turn. When a Hero
is killed, it is assumed that the rest of the party brings their
body back to Camp to try to get them resurrected (or at least
for a proper burial). A Dead Hero may not be looted for their
Items and equipment.  

### Resurrection in Camp
One of the options available to a party that has lost one
of their own is to visit the Anchored Ship in Camp and pay to
have that Hero Resurrected. It can be quite expensive though!  
Any or all of the other Heroes in the party may contribute
Gold toward the cost for the Resurrection, including the Dead
Hero himself (selling his Items if need be to pay for the cost).  
Resurrecting a Dead
Hero is not time-sensitive
(though they may start
to smell a bit), and if
need be, you can even
start a new Hero and
try to build up enough
Gold to pay for your
other Dead Hero’s
Resurrection after
some time.  

## Optional Rules
This section covers Optional Rules that can be added to the game as long as all of the players agree before the game begins.
These Optional Rules are all independent of one another and should each be considered on an individual basis. The rules for
Fixed Hero Move and Hard-Core Mode are not recommended, but are made available for players that want them.  

### Fixed Hero Move
(Makes the game Less Difficult)  

As an option for players that do not like the idea of rolling
for movement each turn, they may use the Fixed Hero Movement
Optional Rule. With this rule, all Heroes are allowed to move
4 spaces each turn (plus any bonuses or negatives for Items,
Abilities, or Injuries/Mutations they may have).  

### Advanced Encounters
(Makes the game More Difficult)  

Every Unique Room Map Tile
has a specific theme to it, and there
is a matching Encounter card in the
Encounter Deck that shares that
theme. At the bottom of each Map
Card that represents a Unique Room
is a red band that lists the specific
Encounter associated with that
room.  
When using the Advanced
Encounters Optional Rule, any
time a Unique Room is Explored,
the listed Advanced Encounter is
added to that Exploration. Search
the Encounter Deck (and discard
Pile if needed) to find the listed Encounter card
(shuffle the deck afterwords). This is in addition to any other
Encounters or Attacks listed on the Exploration Token. Also,
Advanced Encounters like this cannot be canceled or re-drawn.  

### Below the Darkness
(Makes the game More Difficult)

One way to make the game more deadly is to use the
Below the Darkness Optional Rule. Whenever the Darkness
marker passes the Hero Party marker on the Depth Track
(positioned on a higher numbered step than the Hero Party
marker), from that point forward, all Enemies get a free Elite
Ability as the Darkness has grown ever stronger!  

### Hard-Core Mode
(Makes the game Much More Difficult)  
For players that want a truly Hard Core experience, you
may play Hard-Core Mode. In Hard-Core Mode, any time
a Hero would be KO’d they are instead killed unless they
Recover before the start of the next turn.  
This is a very unforgiving play style and will likely lead
to one or more players having to sit out the remainder of
the game while the rest of the group keeps adventuring (not
generally very fun). It is also especially dangerous for higher
level Heroes, as one bad situation can kill the character you
have been playing for months. Ouch!  
For a slightly softer version of Hard-Core Mode, you
can use the above, but allow Heroes to still be Resurrected
between Adventures in Camp.  

### Themed Threat Decks
(Can make the game More or Less Difficult)  
As more Enemy Types become available and players start
making their own Missions, one fun way to create a Themed
Adventure is to tailor-make your Threat Decks to only include
cards with certain Enemy Types. In this way, you could make
an area that is overrun with nothing but Serpentmen Enemies
or perhaps have a theme of only Void creatures that have spilled
out of a portal and are pouring out of the shadows.  
This can be done with just a single Adventure Set, but
really opens up once you have more Enemy Types available
to you. It is also very simple to do as the Threat Decks are all
card based and can easily be Themed or shuffled back together
at the start of each Adventure.  

### Dangerous Bombs
(Makes the game More Difficult)  
Black powder bombs can be a very powerful tool to
take out groups of Enemies or do some damage against high
Defense targets. Thematically though, it is a dangerous thing
to just be carrying around in your Side Bag with you.  
To represent this extra element of danger, you may elect
to use the Dangerous Bombs Optional Rule. Any time a Hero
takes 10 or more Wounds from a single source, they must roll
a D6 for each Bomb Token they have in their Side Bag. For
each roll of 1 or 2, that Token immediately explodes, centered
on the Hero’s space.  

### Combining Sets
When combining this Adventure Set with other Adventure
Sets (such as the Gates of Valhalla), all of the components can
be seamlessly added together, shuffling card decks that have the
same card back together and allowing for a mixed Hero Party
from different genres, having crossed through portals to team
up against the Darkness..  
The only components not recommended to be mixed
together when combining Adventure Sets are the Loot Deck,
Scavenge Deck, and the stack of Exploration Tokens.  
You will also note that several of the card decks, such as
Gear, Darkness, and Growing Dread, have a unique icon in
the upper left corner of the card face that denotes the genre it
is from (Viking, Conquistador, Feudal Japanese, etc). These
cards do share the same card back across sets, and can be fully
mixed together, but they can also be kept separate to be drawn
only while in the corresponding environments to maintain the
theme, if desired.  
When combing this Adventure Set with one of the larger
Core Sets (such as City of the Ancients), you will find that
the Loot Deck, Scavenge Deck, and Exploration Tokens are
different. These are designed so that you can choose to use just
the Loot Deck from the Adventure Set (8 cards), just the Loot
Deck from the Core Set (12 cards), or combine them into a
single larger Loot Deck (20 cards). The same applies for the
Scavenge Deck and the Exploration Token stack.  

## Conquistador Heroes
The Conquistador Hero Class introduced in the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set is a Team Hero Class with 4 distinct versions or Sub-Classes
for Players to choose from - the El Capitan, Explorer, Duelist, and Soldier. All of these Sub-Classes of Conquistador have a
similar theme and share the same basic Abilities, but each has its own unique stats, equipment, and Starting Upgrades, making
them play very differently. This section provides an overview of the different Conquistador Sub-Classes, as well as the rules and
Abilities common to all Conquistador Heroes.  

### Team Hero Class - Conquistador
As a Team Hero Class, all of the Conquistador Heroes
share the same basic Abilities, including the use of Ambition
tokens. They also have access to the use of Conquistador Team
Ability cards, representing their history of training, living, and
fighting alongside one another for years.  

### Conquistador Personal Items
This set also includes a deck of Conquistador Personal
Items that are meant to be used when creating a new
Conquistador Hero.  

### Ambition (Ability Token)
Conquistador Heroes are well known for their
Ambition, both in terms of warfare and personal
glory. To represent this, Conquistador Heroes use
Ambition Tokens.  
Ambition Tokens are very similar to Grit and
can be used on any roll that Grit could be used on. Ambition
allows the Hero to Re-roll any SINGLE die they just rolled,
but adds +2 to the result of the Re-roll.  
This is incredibly powerful for when you really need to
pass a skill test, get that Critical Hit, or add just a little more
Damage to take down an Enemy. Ambition can even Re-roll
a die that has already been Re-rolled (breaking one of the
basic rules of the game)!  
However, each Hero may only use 1 Ambition per Turn for
this Re-roll ability (it may still be used for other abilities that
require Ambition in the same turn).  
Conquistador Heroes have a Max Ambition which is how
many Ambition Tokens they can hold at one time.  
Conquistadors start every Adventure with 1 Ambition as
well as their normal 1 Grit. During the Adventure, whenever
the Hero would Recover a Grit, they may choose to either
Recover a Grit as normal or Recover an Ambition. This works
whether they rolled a 1 for movement, used a Tonic Side Bag
Token, or any other method for Recovering Grit.  
Though Ambition and Grit are fairly similar, Players will
discover that each has its distinct uses, and the ability to collect
and use both gives Conquistadors a powerful advantage with
many interesting tactical choices.  
It is also important to note that Ambition cannot be used
during a Camp/Town stay, and cannot be used to cancel
Growing Dread cards like Grit can (more on that later).  

### Ruthless Warfare
All Conquistador Heroes also have the Ruthless Warfare
ability. This allows them to gain $10 and Heal either 1 Wound
or 1 Sanity Damage whenever they kill an Enemy, but also
reduces their Corruption Resistance to only 4 (normally it is
5), meaning that they are more susceptible to being corrupted
by the Darkness and gaining Mutations.  

### Team Ability Cards
Team Ability cards are unique to the Team Hero Class
and represent the fighting tactics and thematic skills of a group
of well-trained warriors who depend on one another in battle.  

### Drawing Team Ability Cards
As noted in their Abilities
box, at the start of each Adventure,
every Conquistador Hero adds 1
Conquistador Team Ability card
to the Hero Party’s Team Ability
Card Pool. These cards are intended
to encourage team play with Players
discussing how and when would be
best to use the various cards in the
Pool throughout the Adventure.  

### Playing Team Ability Cards
Team Ability cards are generally one-use bonuses for the
Adventure that are discarded after they are used. Each card says
on it when it can be played, who is affected by it, and what the
bonus is for playing the card.  
Although all of the Team Ability cards are held in a single
Pool for the Hero Party, whichever Hero added a particular
card to the Pool gets final say on how and when that card is
played.  
It is important to note that Team Ability cards are drawn
new at the start of each Adventure, and any unused Team
Ability cards still in the Pool at the end of the Adventure are
discarded.  
> Team Ability cards do NOT affect Allies such as
the Conquistador Footmen Allies that come with this
set.  

### Armor
Most Conquistador Heroes rely
on Armor to protect them from
wounds. This can come in the form
of a simple breast plate to a full suit
of Conquistador armor, like what a
Soldier would wear.  

# Mutation Chart

To roll a D36, roll two dice of different colors, where one of them is the '10's digit and the other is the '1's digit. 
For Example, if you rolled 3 and 5 the result on the chart would be 35.

D36 Mutation

11 - Chest Portal  
A hole has opened up in your chest leading to another dimension! And occasionally... stuff comes through! Anytime an 11 or 12 is rolled to Hold Back the Darkness, you must roll a D6.

On 1, 2, or 3, there is an Ambush Attack! as a Low Threat card erupts from the portal in your chest. These Enemies are all placed adjacent to you if possible, but will select targets during their first Activation.

On 4 or 5, nothing happens.

On 6, something starts itching in your portal and you reach in only to pull out a foreign object. Draw a Mine Artifact card.

12 - Tentacle Fingers
Gross! No game effect.

22 - Rock Skin
Your skin becomes hard and crusty, like it's made of rock. You are +3 Health, but -1 Move each turn (minimum of 1).  

23 - Slippery Skin
Your skin is now oily and greasy, allowing you to slide past Enemies and slip through tight spaces. You may now roll an extra die for Escape tests and choose which roll to use.

24 - Melty Skin  
Your skin has become gooey and comes off easily now. Any time you take one or more Wounds from a source, you take 1 extra Wound.

25 - Void Boils  
You are -2 Health, but +1 Max Grit.

26 - Void Infection  
Any time you pass through a Gate, you take 1 Corruption Point, ignoring Willpower.

Your tail talks to you in hushed demonic whispers, curling around to speak into your ear. Any time you take one or more Sanity Damage from a source, you take 1 extra Sanity Damage.

34 - Tail with a Mouth
Your tail nips and bites at you and any others that stray too close. Any time you or another model adjacent to you rolls a 1 on a 'To Hit' roll, that model takes 1 Wound, ignoring Defense. No XP is gained.  

35 - Tentacle Tail  
+1 Move. You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

36 - Void Plague

One of your eyes has grown over with gnarled flesh. All of your Critical Hits do 1 less Damage than normal.

You have grown a third eye that can see into the Void. Once per turn, you may spend 2 Grit to force a Threat card just drawn to be discarded and Re-drawn.

44 - Mouth Grown Over  
You can no longer speak (at least nothing beyond mumbling). All Item prices in Town cost you +$10.  

45 - Fangs
You have grown large, sharp fangs that protrude from your mouth. You gain a Bite Free Attack - Once per turn. 1 Combat, uses the D8 for Damage.  

If this Bite attack wounds a Void Enemy, you also take 1 Corruption Hit.

46 - Second Head
They say two heads are better than one...I'm not so sure. You may now use 2 Clothing - Hat Items and you are +1 Initiative. However, any time you roll a natural 6+ for movement, you lose your Activation, as your two heads are arguing over where to go next.

From now on, that Item may not be unequipped.

55 - Fused with Rock
Your skin has fused with chunks of rock, making you lumbering and slow. You are -2 Move each turn (minimum of 1), however, you also gain Armor 4+.

56 - Fused with Dark Stone
Any Dark Stone shards you currently carry have become fused to you. These cannot be sold, used, or lost in any way until this Mutation is removed, and will continue to roll for corruption at the end of each Adventure as long as they are attached to you.

New Dark Stone found and Items with Dark Stone Icons do not become fused, only the shards that you currently carry when this Mutation is rolled.  

If you aren't carrying any Dark Stone shards when this Mutation is rolled, instead, one Item you have with a Dark Stone Icon you are carrying has become fused to you. If that Item requires a Hand to use, it is considered permanently equipped.

61 - Dark Stone Allergy  
At the start of each of your Activations, take 1 Hit for every Dark Stone shard and Item with a Dark Stone Icon you are carrying (maximum of 5 Hits).

62 - Nose Fallen Off
You are in bad shape. All of your Town Location Event Chart rolls are -1 to the roll (minimum of 2).

63 - Fused Fingers
Your fingers have fused together making it impossible to do any fine manipulation. You may not use Gun Items (unless it is an Artifact card).

64 - Eye Stalks  
All of your Critical Hits are +1 Damage. You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

65 - Void Speech
You can now understand what Void creatures are saying as they hiss and growl. This is unnerving to the extreme, but can give you a leg up in a fight.

You are also -1 Corruption Resistance.

Here is the travel hazard chart in markdown format:

# Travel Hazard Chart

3D6 Traveling Hazard

3 - Possession  
As you settle in for the night around the fire, there is an odd chill in the air. With a contorted face and twisted form, one of the posse is possessed by a vile demon, lashing out and speaking in tongues before regaining control! ‘You will all die before the might of the Ancient Ones...rez’chu’kau’to! Your souls will burn...Has’te’for’i...in the fires of Cynder! Beli’al will have his revenge!”

The Hero that rolled this result immediately loses D3 Sanity permanently, and must roll once on the Madness chart as a result of this horrific experience.

4 - Void Storm
A Void Storm has swept through the area, devastating the region, carrying away buildings, and mutating the livestock and people! It is not a pretty sight.  

When you arrive in Town, 2 Random Buildings have been Destroyed by the Void Storm and cannot be visited during this Town Stay. Also, every Hero gains 1 Corruption Point, ignoring Willpower, for passing though the residual energy of the storm.

5 - Living Hills
Something’s not right here, the hills surrounding the valley you are in seem to be shifting and stirring before your eyes! The road before you opens up to reveal a massive demonic maw waiting to devour you whole!  

Each Hero must make an Agility 5+ test to avoid the maw! If passed, gain 15 XP and you escape the trap. If failed, you leap aside at the last moment. Any Cart or Horse you were riding is devoured by the beast and you lose 1 Sanity permanently at the horrific sight of the creature!

6 - Flash Flood  
As you travel through the canyons, the skies open up with rain, causing a flash flood directly in your path!  

Each Hero must make a Luck 4+ test to avoid being swept away by the rushing waters. If failed, roll a D6 for each Token in your Side Bag. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, it is swept away in the torrent of water.

7 - Harried By HellBats
As the Heroes move through the countryside, dark swarms of HellBats follow overhead, swooping down to terrorize them as they go.

Each Hero must roll a D6 for every Dark Stone they are carrying (including Items with a Dark Stone Icon and Items with Dark Stone Upgrades on them). On the roll of 1, that Dark Stone shard/Item is snatched away by a HellBat and carried off into the night (discarded).

8 - Snake Oil Salesman  
You meet a traveling salesman on the road who excitedly opens up the sides of his cart and shows you his wares. He spins a good yarn about the medicinal quality of his tonics!

Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test. If passed, you recognize a scam when you see one and pass on the deal. 

If failed, you eagerly buy some of the elixirs only to discover that they are little more than flavored water and pungent herbs as the dust cloud from the salesman’s cart disappears in the distance. Lose D6x$25 and roll a D6. On the roll of 6, one of the elixirs is actually worthwhile. Gain a Tonic Token.

9 - Burning Farmstead  
Pillars of black smoke rise in the distance and as you approach you discover a farmstead in ruins and ablaze! Screams call out from the fiery inferno! 

Each Hero may decide to turn away or brave the burning building to look for survivors. If you enter the building make a Strength 5+ test to move through the flaming debris.  

If failed, you are singed by the fire and must flee the building, coughing from the thick smoke. Take D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense, that carry over to the next Adventure. If passed gain 25 XP and roll a D6 to see what you find in the fire.

D6 Roll Result  

1-4 - Gear - You find something of value. Draw a Gear card.

5 - Artifact - Perhaps this is why the creatures attacked them! Draw an Artifact card from the Mines.

6 - Survivor! - You find someone still alive in the wreckage. Packing them on your saddle, you race back to Town. If you visit the Doc's Office during this Town Stay, gain +1 Max Grit for your heroic efforts.

10 - Bridge Destroyed
The bridge across the canyon ahead has been demolished, either blown up to prevent demons from coming across, or torn apart during a skirmish! You’ll have to find another way around, which will take time...time you don’t have.

When you get to Town, the Heroes can spend no more than 2 days for their Town Stay before starting the next Adventure.

11 - Dark Dreams  
Camping along the trail, your dreams are filled with dark visions of the future and an impending dread.  

Each Hero must make a Spirit 6+ test. If passed gain 10 XP and you may Recover 1 Grit.  

If failed, you take D6 Sanity Damage, ignoring Willpower, that carry over to the next Adventure.

12 - Blighted Desert
The desert is dry and unforgiving. As you come across the first watering hole for miles, the area around it is littered with the bones of the dead! Not a good sign.  

Each Hero loses 1 Grit. If you do not have a Grit to lose, instead take D3 Wounds, ignoring Defense, that carry over to the next Adventure.

13 - Bandits!  
Waylaid by Bandits on the road, the Heroes fend off as many as they can!  

The Bandits surround each Hero individually. There are 5 Bandits per Hero and each Hero must roll a D6 to see how many of those Bandits they defeat. For every Bandit you defeat, gain 10 XP. For each of your 5 Bandits you do not defeat, lose $25, 1 Dark Stone, or 1 Gear or Artifact of your choice.

14 - Gulch Ambush
Traveling through a dusty gulch you get a bad feeling...but it’s too late! Feathered arrows whiz past your head as a savage group of Black Fang tribe Indians descend from the cliff tops, hungry for Dark Stone!

Each Hero must make an Agility 5+ or Lore 5+ test. If passed, gain 25 XP and you are able to evade the worst of the attack, escaping into the hills to meet up with the rest of the posse. 

If failed, you are knocked to the ground as the Black Fang scavenge your belongings for Dark Stone. Lose D3 Dark Stone, or one item with a Dark Stone Icon. Also, due to your bumps and bruises, you lose all Grit.

15 - Void Hound Attack  
A pack of vicious Void Hounds have been tracking your posse for days and have found the opportunity to strike!

Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test to outwit the Hounds or a Strength 5+ test to overpower them. If passed, gain 25 XP.

If failed, you are pulled from your saddle and ravaged by the creatures! Roll a D6 for every Clothing Item you have (not including your Personal Item). On the roll of 1 or 2 it is torn apart and destroyed by the savage attack.

16 - Massacred Wagon Train
You come across the twisted wreckage and broken bodies of a wagon train, torn apart by creatures!  

Each Hero can decide to pass it by without looking too close, or to sift through the gore to look for anything useful. If you search the massacre, make a Luck 5+ test. If failed, lose 1 Sanity permanently, as you are scarred by the horror of the things you find. If passed, roll a D6 to see what you find.

17 - Army Convoy
Traveling the roads, the Heroes come upon a massive US Army convoy heading toward the same Town to reinforce the outpost there.  

When the Heroes reach Town, any rolls on the Camp Site Hazard chart or the Town Event Chart are +1 to the roll.

18 - Shadowy Traveler  
You meet a dark stranger on the road one night while the rest of the posse is asleep. With a slippery voice he introduces himself as Mr. Scratch and makes you an offer that could be hard to refuse.

This result may NOT be Re-rolled or canceled. The Hero who rolled this result may either take the deal, gaining D6x100 XP and D6x$100, but if they ever roll this result again, Mr. Scratch has returned to collect his end of the bargain and takes your Hero off into the night never to be heard from again.

If you refuse the deal, make a Spirit 6+ or Cunning 6+ test to find a way out of it. If passed, gain 50 XP. If failed, gain D6+1 Corruption Points, ignoring Willpower, as Mr. Scratch disappears into the dark night.

Here are the rules for missions on pages 10 and 11 formatted in markdown:

# Missions

Missions are the backbone of Shadows of Brimstone, describing a story set up, the goals, special rules, and reward for successfully completing the Adventure. There are 12 different Missions included in a typical Core Set, and each can be played many times, as the map, cards, and story unfold differently every time you play.

## Selecting a Mission

When you are setting up for a game of Shadows of Brimstone, one of the key factors is deciding what Mission you will play. The For a Few Dark Stone More Mission is a great entry point for all groups of new Heroes starting their career of adventure.

### Rolling Randomly vs Choosing

When you are ready for your next Adventure, you can either select a Mission from the list to play, or, if you are feeling adventurous, you can roll randomly to determine your next Mission using the list below.  

If you are new to the game, it is recommended that you play though several of the Basic Missions before moving on to any of the Advanced Missions.

### Linking Missions

When playing as a campaign and keeping your Heroes from game to game, it is sometimes fun to link your Missions thematically, one after another. Though none of the Missions introduced here directly affect one another, it is easy to imagine how they might be chained together to form a narrative.

For example, if you play Exploration and succeed, you may determine that you need to Seal the Void Gate that you discovered along the way. While if you failed, you might need to form a Search Party to rescue someone carried off by the Darkness you let escape. Then if you failed to Seal the Void Gate, perhaps you should really just Blow the Mine, as it’s the only way to be sure. While if you succeeded, maybe too many creatures got through before the gate was sealed and now you have to Escape to get away alive. The narrative possibilities are endless.

## Elements of a Mission

Every Mission has a short story description as well as several features.

### Set Up 

describes the starting board arrangement and any special markers or cards the Heroes start with.

### Mission Goal 

describes what the Heroes need to do to complete the Mission.

### Special Rules

tell what extra rules are used that are specific to the Mission.

### Objectives

describes what Clue Icons are used for during the Mission (if relevant) as well as what the final Objective Room may hold. It also tells how the Mission is successfully completed by the Heroes.

### Reward 

details what bonuses the Heroes get if they successfully complete the Mission. 

### Failure

tells what happens if the Heroes lose the Mission - by all being KO’d, letting the Darkness Escape the Mines, etc.

## Mission Special Rules

Most Missions have one or more Special Rules. Often, the same Special Rule can be found in multiple different Missions. 

Special Rules marked with ‘(Objective)’ specifically relate to the Objectives of the Mission (usually only taking effect while in the final Objective Room).

Here are the rules for fixed map missions formatted in markdown:

# Fixed Map Missions

Some Missions use a fixed map rather than a randomly generated board. For these Missions, the board is created at the start of the game, as shown in the Mission’s Set Up section and map diagram.

The Map Decks are generally not used for these Missions as the entire Map is constructed during Set Up.

## Exploration Tokens

Exploration Tokens (if used) are placed on the board as shown in the map diagram. As normal, during the Room Exploration phase of the turn, if there are one or more Heroes on a Map Tile with an Exploration Token, that Token is revealed.  

During a Fight, models may not move onto a Map Tile that has an unrevealed Exploration Token.

## New Doors and Gates 

Door and Gate Icons on Exploration Tokens are not used in Fixed Map Missions, as the board is already pre-set. Any time a new Door or Gate would appear (from an Encounter card, etc.), ignore that new Door or Gate, it simply does not come into play.

## Placing Enemies

With a Fixed Map, Rooms no longer always have an obvious ‘Entrance’. Because normal Enemy placement starts at the opposite side of the Room from the ‘Entrance’, simply treat the side of the Room that the Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from as the ‘Entrance’ to that Room.  

If Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from two different directions in the same turn, roll off to see which of the two sides counts as the ‘Entrance’.


# Traveling to Town

When keeping your Heroes from game to game in a campaign, it is important to be able to resupply and get pesky Injuries, Madness, or Mutations Healed. To do this, Heroes can Travel across the countryside to reach a Frontier Town. Traveling in the shadows of the Brimstone cataclysm can be a dangerous prospect, even for the most hearty of Heroes, so beware.

## Resetting Heroes for Travel and Town

As noted in the Campaign Play section of the Rule Book, there are a series of steps the Heroes go through at the End of Each Adventure. This represents the Heroes regrouping outside the Mines.

### Mission Success or Failure

The success or failure of the previous Mission can have an impact on your Traveling or the Town you visit, as noted in the individual Mission just played. Oftentimes, failing a Mission will lead to one or more Locations in Town being Destroyed by the Darkness that you let Escape from the local mines.

### Preparing to Travel

Once the Heroes are ready to Travel, every Hero in the Posse must roll a D6. 

- A Hero that rolls a 1 or 2 on the die adds a Travel Hazard to the journey.

### Rolling for Travel Hazards

Once you have established how many Travel Hazards there will be, each Hero that added a Hazard to the trip must roll once on the Travel Hazard Chart. This can be done in any order, but each Travel Hazard roll must be completed before the next roll on the chart is made.

Note that Travel Hazards usually affect the whole group, but on occasion, they will specifically affect the Hero that triggered the Hazard/rolled the result on the chart.

The Travel Hazard Chart can be found at the back of this book, on page 56.

To roll on the chart, a Hero rolls 3D6 and adds them together. The result (between 3 and 18) is then consulted on the chart to see what the Heroes have encountered in their Travels.

### Completing Your Travels

Once all of the Travel Hazards are rolled for and resolved (and there may not have been any at all, if none of the Heroes rolled a 1 or 2 on their Travel die), the Heroes have reached their destination. Arriving at a Frontier Town, the Heroes may now interact with that Town, as described below.

## Horses and the Stage Coach

One thing that Heroes can buy while in Town is a specialty Transport, in the form of a Horse or a Stage Coach. It is assumed that every Hero has a basic Horse that lets them Travel between the mines and towns, and is left outside when delving down into the mines for an Adventure. This basic Horse does not give any bonuses and cannot be Upgraded in any way (with Dark Stone Horse Shoes, etc). Buying a specialized Horse or a Stage Coach for the Posse gives you bonuses for Traveling. These can be found at the Blacksmith in Town.

As the Stage Coach is an Item used by the whole Posse, it is limited to One per Hero Posse, as noted in its store entry. It is still purchased by a single Hero and they are considered the owner of it (or driver). The Heroes may pool their Gold, of course, to help pay for it though, as it is an expensive purchase.

As noted, every Hero is reset to full Health, full Sanity, and 1 Grit before Traveling to visit a Frontier Town.


# Visiting a Frontier Town

Once the Heroes have completed their Traveling, they reach a Frontier Town in which to buy supplies and equipment, as well as to try to Heal Injuries or Madness, or even get Corruption and Mutations removed. Of course, just because you are in a Town, it does not mean that you are safe. This is the Old West after all, and there are always dark forces at play.

The Town is represented by a small board that shows the various Locations you can visit as well as the Hotel or Camp Site you will be staying in. It also has a Town Event Track to show how long the Heroes have been in Town since the last Event occurred.

## Setting up the Town Board

The Town Board is printed on the back side of the Depth Event Chart and should be laid out at the center of the table where all Players can reach it. Place the Hero Posse marker on the ‘1’ space of the Town Event Track.

## The Town Board

### The Town Event Track

At the end of each Day in Town, the Heroes will have to make a single roll to see if a Town Event has occurred. These are usually fairly bad things and best to be avoided. The more Days that have passed since the last Town Event, the more likely it is that one will happen, so staying in Town for too long can get a bit risky. Rolling for Town Events and the Town Event Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet.

### Town Locations

There are 6 Locations that the Heroes can visit while in Town - the Doc's Office, Blacksmith, Saloon, Frontier Outpost, Church, and General Store. Each Location has Items that you can purchase as well as a unique Event Chart and specialty services. They are also each represented by a large, double-sided reference sheet that can be passed around the table as Heroes visit the different Locations.

#### Random Town Locations 

Sometimes determining a Random Town Location will be required. When this happens, simply roll a D6 and consult the numbers in the bottom corner of each of the Location spaces on the Town Board. Note that the Hotel and Camp Site are not numbered and will never be selected Randomly like this.

#### Destroyed Town Locations

Sometimes one or more Town Locations will be Destroyed. When this happens, place a marker on that Location to show that Heroes may not visit it for the rest of this Town Stay.

## A Day in Town

### The Hotel and the Camp Site

At the start of each Day in Town, each Hero must decide if they want to stay at the Hotel for the cost of $10, or if they would rather stay at the Camp Site for Free. Players should place their Hero on the Town Board in either the Hotel or Camp Site space.

Though the Camp Site does not cost Gold to stay at, it can be a little rough. Any Hero staying at the Camp Site must roll 2D6 on the Camp Site Hazard Chart to see if anything happens. This Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet. Heroes staying at the Hotel simply pay their $10 for the Day.

### Visiting a Town Location

Each Hero is allowed to visit one Town Location a Day. All of the Heroes should move their figure to the Location space on the Town Map that they wish to visit for the Day. 

#### Location Event Charts

Once all of the Heroes are at the Location they have chosen for the Day, each Hero must roll 2D6 on the Location Event Chart for the Location they are visiting. These charts can be found on the individual large reference sheets for the different Locations.

Very often a Location Event Chart result will affect all of the Heroes at that Location for the Day.

### Buying Equipment and Services

Once all of the Location Events have been rolled for and resolved, Heroes may purchase Items and pay for special services at the Location they are visiting. 

The cost for each Item or service is listed on the Location's reference sheet. When a Hero spends Gold to pay for an Item or service, the amount is deducted from that Hero's Gold total (just like in real life). Gold can sometimes be hard to come by though, so spend it wisely (again, just like in real life).

### Selling Dark Stone

Dark Stone may also be sold, but only to the Outpost Bank located at the Frontier Outpost Location. Details for this can be found on the Location's reference sheet.

### Selling Items

While in Town, a Hero may elect to sell any Item card they have for the amount of Gold listed in the bottom right corner of the card. Discard the card and add the Gold value to your Hero. This can be done at any time, regardless of where in Town you are. 

Items purchased in Town may also be sold later for 50% of the value you paid to get the Item. Services, of course, may not be sold as they were a one time event that you paid for.

#### Hero Starting Gear

Heroes may NOT trade or give their Starting Items to other Heroes, and may NOT choose to sell their Starting Items in Town.

When called on to discard an Item (by an event or Travel Hazard, for instance), a Hero may NOT choose to discard a Starting Item (though a Starting Item MAY be lost when discarding a ‘Random Item’).

A Starting Item MAY be discarded voluntarily, to make room for carrying other Items.

Because Starting Gear cards are a fundamental part of every Hero Class, if a Hero's Starting Item has been lost/discarded, they MAY purchase a replacement of it in Town, at any time (no specific Location is required), for the Gold Value listed on that Item. If there is no Gold Value listed, the Hero may acquire a replacement for free.

### End of the Day 

Once all of the Heroes have finished their Location visit, the Day ends and the Heroes must roll to see if a Town Event occurs. If it does, the Town Event must be resolved and affects all Heroes in Town. If not, then the Day ends quietly with a nice sunset over the mountains.

Then, a new Day begins and the process is repeated.

### Leaving Town

Any Heroes that do not want to spend any more time in Town may elect to Leave Town at the end of a Day, after the Town Event is rolled for and resolved. Once a Hero Leaves Town, they may not return until after the next Adventure, but are no longer affected by any Town Events that may occur.


# Hero Classes and Leveling Up
There are several different Hero Classes that players can choose from in Shadows of Brimstone, each with their own style of play and unique feel. Keeping your Hero from game to game allows them to progress in Hero Level, gaining new abilities and collecting all manner of Gear and Artifacts along the way to help in their Adventures against tougher and tougher Enemies.

Once your Hero has collected enough XP, you can spend it to go up to the next Hero Level. This will usually grant you more Health/Sanity, Skill boosts, and even a new Ability unique to your Hero Class.

### Spending XP to Level Up
The amount of XP required to ‘Level Up’ to the next Hero Level is shown on the chart below.

### Choosing an Upgrade Chart Ability
Every Hero Class also has an Upgrade Chart that acts as a skill tree of new abilities, unique to your Hero Class. Each time you Level Up, you may choose one new Ability from your Upgrade Chart.

The chart has four different vertical Tracks that run top to bottom and are themed for a particular aspect of that Hero Class. When choosing a new Ability, you may pick from any of the four Tracks, but you must take the first Ability in that Track that you do not already have. In other words, you must have the first tier Ability in a Track before you can take the second tier ability below it, etc. Note that as the Hero Level cap is 8, a Hero will not be able to get the fourth tier ability in more than one of the different Tracks, so choose wisely as you Level Up.

### Mark Down Your New Level
Once you have spent the required XP to Level Up, make a note of your new Hero Level to keep track of where you are.

### Hero Level Cap
Heroes max out at Level 8. Though you can continue to acquire XP and keep Adventuring, you may not Level Up beyond Hero Level 8 (at least not yet).

### Leveling Up Mid-Game
As soon as a Hero has enough XP, they may spend that XP to Level Up. This may even be done during an Adventure! A Hero may Level Up at the start of a Game Turn by spending the appropriate amount of XP. That Hero immediately Fully Heals their Health and Sanity, and Recovers 1 Grit. They may then immediately gain the benefits of Leveling Up as noted below.

It is important to note that XP is actually spent to Level Up, removing the XP from your Hero’s XP total.

Just like each individual Hero has a Hero Level, the group as a whole has a Hero Posse Level. The Hero Posse Level is equal to the highest Level Hero currently in the group, so a group with a Level 2 Hero, two Level 3 Heroes, and a Level 4 Hero would be Hero Posse Level 4.

The Hero Posse Level is set at the start of each Adventure and allows for different Heroes to come and go from the group from game to game. Once an Adventure starts, the Hero Posse Level does NOT change, even if one or more Heroes Level Up mid-game.

### Tougher Monsters
As the Heroes go up in Level, the Enemies that you fight will also naturally get more difficult. All of the Enemies in an Adventure get a Bonus based on the Hero Posse Level at the start of that Adventure as follows:

| Posse Level | Enemy Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No Bonus |
| 2 | No Bonus |
| 3 | 1 Elite Ability |
| 4 | 2 Elite Abilities |
| 5 | Brutal Side of Enemies |
| 6 | Brutal Side of Enemies |
| 7 | Brutal + 1 Elite Ability |
| 8 | Brutal + 2 Elite Abilities |

Remember also that Elite Enemies are +5XP for each Elite Ability they have. Brutal Enemies are worth more XP as listed on their sheet.

A Hero that has enough XP to Level Up MUST do so before the next Adventure begins.

### Roll for Free Upgrade Bonus
Each Hero Class has a free Upgrade Bonus Chart. Whenever your Hero Levels Up, you get to roll 2D6 on the Chart to determine your random bonus. This is in addition to choosing a new Ability for your Hero.

|Hero Level|XP Cost|
|---|---|
|1|Start|
|2|500|
|3|1,000|
|4|2,000|
|5|3,000|
|6|4,500|
|7|6,000|
|8|8,000|

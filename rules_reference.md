# Shadows of Brimstone - Rules Compilation

This is a text reference of rules compilation for Shadows of Brimstone. The core game rules across all Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been merged into a single reference that is not specific to any particular Core Set or Adventure Set. Additional rules across expansions is also included. The only rules not included in this reference are text on various game cards, charts, Missions, Hero Sheets, and Enemy Reference Sheets. These references can be found in separate documents.  

Note that many of the official game rules in PDF and printed format include visual elements such as icons, thematic artwork, graphic design elements, and diagrams that are not included in this text-only version of the rules.  

This text-only version of the rules is intended to be easily referenced by AI models as training data and reference information for context. As a result, the formatting may be more flat and simple, but less visually readable for humans.  

Since many AI models cannot currently work with other data types than text (such as images, video, and audio), important image data for explaining the rules are given text keywords with text-based descriptions. These visual elements, such as icons, tokens, markers, and diagrams, are summarized with a keyword or letter in curly braces {} throughout the rules. As a short-hand, text descriptions of each symbol and other visual element is provided for AI models in the list below:  

- {P}: Peril Die Icon. This depicts a yellow 6-sided die. The Peril Die is larger and physically distinct from the other D6 dice that come with the game, and has embossed number values with a worn, frayed background etched into the die. The Peril Die does not use standard 1-6 values, but instead has the following values on its 6 faces: 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. Whenever the game official game rules display a visual icon of the Peril Die, this reference will use {P} instead.
- {C}: Clue Icon. Clue icons are usually displayed on Exploration Tokens. Visually the look like a small red circle with a white exclamation mark in the center and a bit of drop shadow around the circle. Clue icons can have a somewhat abstract meaning depending on the context of the mission being played. Most missions will assign some special meaning to Clue Icons found on Exploration Tokens during a Mission.

## Game Overview
Shadows of Brimstone is a fast-paced, Cooperative, dungeon-crawl boardgame with set in a variety of fantastic worlds. Each player creates a character. Forming a party of Heroes, the players take their characters on great adventures.  

Missions are designed for maximum replayability as everything you encounter, including the board layout, is dynamically generated as the story unfolds. Explore the various worlds and locations, overcoming dangerous encounters and fighting ruthless creatures, while collecting useful Gear and ancient Artifacts to aid in your adventures. Heroes can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their expedition on the other side.  

With a robust campaign system, Hero characters can be kept from game to game, earning experience and going up in levels to increase their skills and gain new abilities. The Heroes can also visit Towns, and sometimes Cities and Expedition Camps, spending their hard earned money on goods and services.  

So unfurl the sails, take up your sword, and strap on your armor, the Darkness closes in, adventure awaits!  

## Players
Shadows of Brimstone is a fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. If combining a Core Set or Adventure Set with another Core Set or additional Hero Packs, this can be increased to 5-6 players. All of the players work together against the game itself and the difficulty is scaled based on the number of Heroes taking part in each adventure.

## Dice
The game comes with 16 standard six-sided dice (8 White and 8 Red) that should be divided amongst the players. There are two colors of dice included, as often players will want to roll a group of dice together with some of them being special (ex. - “the Red dice are for Critical Hits”). Often cards will refer to the terms D6 and D3. D6 is just another name for a six-sided die. D3 means to roll a six-sided die using the following results:  

- 1-2 = 1
- 3-4 = 2
- 5-6 = 3

### Re-rolls
There are many things in the game that let you Re-roll one or more dice. It is important to note though that:  
**You may not Re-roll the same die more than once.**  

### 8-Sided Die
The game also comes with an 8-sided die which is used for some special rolls. This die is often referred to as a D8.  

### Peril Die {P}
There is also a larger, special six-sided die included called the Peril Die. This die is marked with the numbers 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. It is most often used for determining the quantity of Enemies during an attack, and is represented on cards as a {P} symbol.  

## Wounds and Sanity Damage
Red Wound Markers are placed on Heroes and Enemies to keep track of how much damage they have taken during the game, while blue Sanity markers are placed on Heroes to show how much Sanity Damage they have taken. There are individual Wound/Sanity Markers as well as larger markers representing 5 Wounds/Sanity each.  

## Ability Tokens
The term Ability Token is used to refer to
any of the various special tokens used by Hero
Classes to trigger their unique abilities.  

## Ambition Tokens
Conquistador Heroes use a special Ability Token called Ambition. Similar to Grit, it allows them a Re-roll, but for just a single die, with a powerful bonus.  

## Dark Stone
These markers are used to keep track of Dark Stone shards that Heroes find on their adventures.  

## Grit
Grit is a resource that Heroes have that can be used for Re-rolling dice, activating special abilities, or adding a burst of speed to your movement. 

Grit is a resource that represents a Hero’s
ability to tough out difficult situations and pull
off amazing feats; dodging a fatal blow at the
last minute, scoring a particularly difficult hit,
or activating a powerful special ability to save
the day. In short, it allows Heroes to be heroic!
Every Hero has Grit (they wouldn’t be much of
a Hero without it).  

### Using Grit
A Hero may use a Grit to do one of three things:
- Use 1 Grit to Re-roll any number of dice that your
Hero just rolled.
- Use 1 Grit to add an extra D6 to your Hero’s
Movement.
- Use Grit to activate a Special Ability or Item that
requires it.


### Re-roll Limits
Grit can be very useful for Re-rolling dice when you need
to, but it is important to remember that no single die may ever
be Re-rolled more than once. So, for example, you CANNOT
Re-roll all of your misses with a Grit, and then use an ability or
spend another Grit to Re-roll the ones that still missed.
Grit may only be used to Re-roll dice that have been
rolled for your Hero (not other Heroes, Enemies, etc).
In Addition, Grit may not be used on any roll on a Chart
or the roll to Hold Back the Darkness (more on that later).  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is a very powerful resource, but is limited. Each
Hero starts every Mission with 1 Grit, but more can be gained
throughout the Adventure. The most common way to Recover
a Grit is by rolling a 1 for your Move roll. This is covered in
greater detail later in the section on Hero Activation.  

### Max Grit
Every Hero Class has a Max Grit listed on their Character
Sheet. This is generally Max Grit 2 for most new Heroes.
Max Grit is simply the most Grit your Hero can have at one
time.  

If you are already at your Max Grit and you would get to
Recover a Grit, though you can’t hold onto it, you are allowed
to immediately spend that new Grit instead of just losing it.
This is most often used to activate an ability that costs Grit or
to gain the extra D6 to your Move for the turn.  

## Corruption
During the game, Heroes can gain Corruption Points, slowly pushing them down the path of evil and mutation.  

## Exploration Tokens
These markers are placed face down in new rooms discovered as the Heroes explore and, when revealed, tell the number of exits a room has as well as if there are any Encounters or Enemies to be overcome there. Some also have a {C} Clue Icon.  

## Side Bags and Side Bag Tokens
Each Hero has a Side Bag that can carry helpful Tokens for them such as Bandages, Rum, or Bombs.  

## Deuling Tactics
An assortment of Dueling Tactics markers are
included to represent the different tactics that Heroes
can practice in Camp to unleash on their foes in
battle.  

## Scavenged Markers
These markers are used to show when a
Map Tile has been successfully Scavenged by the
Heroes for anything of value.  

## Revive Tokens
These tokens are occasionally used to give
Heroes an extra chance at survival, allowing a
Hero that was just KO’d to get back up
without long-lasting effects.  

## Creeping Shadows
Creeping Shadows are a type of Enemy, that
emerges from the darkness to swarm the Heroes
and attack them from within their space.  

## Hero and KO'd Hero Markers
Hero markers can be used for determining a Random
Hero from the group. KO’d Hero markers are placed in the
space where a Hero was KO’d.  

## Depth Track
The Depth
Track is used
to show how
far into the
unknown the
Heroes have
ventured as well
as showing the
progression of the Darkness as it grows in power and gets
closer to escaping, causing defeat for the Heroes.  

## Darkness Marker
This marks the current position of the
Darkness on the Depth Track and moves up
the track over the course of the game, as the
Darkness tries to escape!  

## Hero Party Marker
This marks the current position of the
Heroes on the Depth Track and moves down
the track as the Heroes explore the map.  

## XP and Gold
XP and Gold are only needed when keeping Heroes
from one Adventure to the next, and are gathered in large
quantities, so no counters are included for them. Instead, it is
recommended that players track their XP and Gold by keeping
a running total of each on a piece of paper.  

## Cards
There are many different decks of cards in the game that
are used for everything from dynamically generating the board
as you explore it, to the Enemies you encounter, to the cool
Gear and Artifacts you find along the way.  

**Keywords**  
Most cards have Keywords associated with them, listed
just below the title of the card. The Keywords usually do not
have any inherent meaning, but are occasionally referenced by
other cards and rules.  

**Icons**  
Many cards contain icons that represent various aspects
of the card. A full list of these icons can be found on the
Reference Summary at the back of this Rulebook.  

**Remains in Play**  
Some cards are listed as Remains in Play. As it sounds,
these cards stay in play and continue to affect the game until
the end of the Adventure, or they are canceled in some way.  

**Discard Piles**  
For each deck of cards in the game there will also be a
discard pile. The discard pile should be formed face up next to
the deck and is where cards from that deck go when they have
been used and are no longer in play. Any player may look
through any discard pile at any time. If any deck ever runs
out of cards, shuffle the discard pile thoroughly and reform the
deck face down.  

Some of the card decks (such as Loot and Scavenge cards)
do not have discard piles, but rather are fully shuffled every
time one or more cards need to be drawn.  

## Card Types

### Gear and Artifact Cards

## Creating A New Hero
Creating a new Hero is fast and easy. It is often just as fun
to start a fresh new Hero as it is to keep one Hero from game
to game, over a series of Adventures. To create a new Hero,
just follow these simple steps:  

### Choose Hero Class (and Sub-Class)
The most important choice for a new Hero is what
Hero Class you want to play, and for a Team Hero like the
Conquistadors, Vikings, or Trederran Strike Team, what Sub-Class you want to play.  
Each Hero Class/Sub-Class has its own unique stats and Abilities,
and a fairly different play style.  
Most standard Hero Classes have no Sub-Class. But Adventure Sets use Team Heroes. In the Valley of the Serpent Kings Adventure Set, 
the Heroes are the Conquistador Hero Class, but there are 4
different Sub-Classes of Conquistador to choose from - El
Capitan, Duelist, Explorer, and Soldier.  

### Get Starting Items
Every Hero Class/Sub-Class has a small list of Starting
Items printed on their Character Sheet that they get for free.
Find these Items for your Hero amongst the Starting Gear
cards. It is important to note that, in many ways, the Starting
Gear of a Hero is just as important a factor as their Abilities
and stats. Note that Heroes may NOT trade or give their
Starting Items to other Heroes.  

### Draw a Personal Item
Every Hero starts their adventuring career with one
Personal Item that not only gives them a powerful bonus,
but can help to define the backstory of that Hero. Draw one
Personal Item card for your Hero.  
Some Hero Classes draw from special themed decks of Personal Item Cards. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not specify a specific deck to draw your Personal Item card from, use the standard deck.

### Choose Your Starting Upgrade
When creating a brand new Hero you get to choose one of
the Hero Starting Upgrades available to your Hero Class. Each
Sub-Class of Conquistador has 2 unique Starting Upgrades
to choose from that help to define your Hero right from the
beginning. Choose wisely though as the Upgrade you don’t
pick will not be available later.  

### Get a Side Bag and Free Token
Take a Side Bag
marker for your Hero.
Every Hero has a Side
Bag that can hold up
to 5 Tokens in it. A
New Hero also gets
to choose one Side Bag
Token to start with for free.
Choose from Rum, Bandages, Tonic,
or Bomb.  

As new Core Sets and Adventure Sets have been released over the years, Heroes that were included in different sets are inteded to pick from a different pool of Side Bag Tokens for their free starting token. Heroes native to different settings and sets should pick from the starting tokens provided in the following table:  

- **Old West Heroes:**
(City of Ancients Core Set, Swamps of Death Core Set, The Impossible Hell Train Core Set, Various Hero Packs)  
  - Bandage
  - Whiskey
  - Tonic 
  - Dynamite

- **Feudal Japanese Heroes:**
(Forbidden Fortress Core Set, Various Hero Packs)
  - Bandage
  - Sake
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Spanish Fort Heroes:**
(Valley of the Serpent King Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - Rum
  - Tonic
  - Bomb

- **Viking Heroes:**
(Gates of Valhalla Adventure Set)
  - Bandage
  - ?
  - Tonic
  - ?

- **Trederran Team Heroes:**
(Trederran Strike Team Expansion)
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?
  - ?

Some specific Heroes, such as a the Jargono Native, may have special rules which allow that Hero to start with a different Side Bag token. If your Hero Class/Sub-Class does not have specify any special tokens, use the previous tables to pick according to the native setting of your Hero's Class/Sub-Class.  

### Name Your Hero
Lastly, you should choose a
fitting name for your Hero. And pick
something good, you never know if that
name will be spoken of as legend in the
royal courts throughout Spain and the world
at large!  

## Adventure Set Up
An Adventure is generally a single play-session where the Heroes try to successfully complete a Mission. While players can choose to play a Campaign, keeping their Heroes across many Adventures and play-sessions, Shadows of Brimstone can also be played as just a single Adventure if players choose.  

To Set Up for an Adventure, complete the following steps in the order listed.  

### Number of Players/Heroes
Decide on the number of Heroes that will be taking part
in the Adventure. Usually this is one Hero per player, but
sometimes it is fun to play a game controlling two or more
Heroes each, for a fewer number of players.  

### Shuffle Card Decks
Thoroughly shuffle all of the required card decks and place them on the table. Most Adventures require the following decks of cards:  
- Darkness
- Growing Dread
- Loot
- Scavenge
- Low, Med, High, and Epic Threats
- Gear
- Artifacts
- Encounters
- Map Cards
- World Card

If playing an Adventure in an OtherWorld, you will need the Threat, Encounters, Map Cards, and Artifacts corresponding to that OtherWorld.  

Note that players may freely mix cards and other content across multiple Core Sets, Adventure Sets, and other expansions as they desire. For example, if playing an Adventure in the Forbidden Fortress as Fedual Japanese Heroes, the players may wish to only include Darkness, Growing Dread, Gear, and Threat cards intended for the Forbidden Fortress setting. Or, they may wish to include cards from any other content as desired!

For Loot and Scavenge decks, players are free to combine cards across multiple Core and Adventure Sets, but doing so is not recommended. The distribution of cards in these two decks provide a mix of good, neutral, and bad effects as intended by the designers.  

Don't forget to place an appropriate World Card face up on the table that matches the World in which your Adventure is taking place, as it may add special gameplay effects as depicted on the card.  

During your Adventures, you
may pass through Gates that allow you to visit strange
alien OtherWorlds. These Worlds each have their own World
card. Some Missions actually begin in an OtherWorld, as
listed in the Mission Set Up.  

### Prepare Exploration Tokens
Shuffle up all 8 Exploration Tokens and create a stack of
them face down that players can draw from when they find a
new room.  

Mixing Exploration Tokens from multiple Core and Adventure Sets is not recommended.

### Ready Heroes
Prepare each Hero that will be taking part. If these are
new Heroes, make sure each of them is ready to go using the
steps of Creating a New Hero.  

One Hero gets the Old Lantern card as the Light Source,
in addition to their other Gear. The players may choose who
will take it at the start of each Adventure.  

Draw Team Ability cards and add them to the pool if any players are using Team Heroes. 

Ensure each Hero has any necessary starting markers, tokens, etc., such as Grit, Ability Tokens (Ambition, Fury, Mana, etc.), free Side Bag Token, etc. 

### Select Mission
Select a Mission to play. For your first time learning the game, this should
be the first Basic Mission included in the Core Set or Adventure Set you are playing with.  

Players may use whatever methods the like to select a Mission. They may pick one by choice, select one randomly, or use whatever methodology they like.  

Note that some Missions have special Set Up instructions.  

### Prepare Depth Track
Place the Depth Track where all players can see it, and
position the Darkness marker on the Darkness Start space and
the Hero Party marker on the Entrance space. Note that some Missions may have special instructions which may modify these rules.  

### Place Entrance Map Tile
Set the Entrance Map Tile in the center of the table,
where all players can reach it.  

### Place Heroes
Lastly, each Hero model is placed on the Entrance Map
Tile in one of the 8 Starting Area spaces.  

The Starting Area on the Entrance Map Tile includes all
8 spaces in the back two rows. The
Heroes can be positioned in any of these eight spaces, and
should be placed on the board in Initiative order, from highest
to lowest.  

## Number of Heroes
The number of Heroes taking part in an Adventure
determines the difficulty and quantity of Enemies you will
be facing. This is scaled in two ways - with Low, Med,
and High Threat Decks for Enemies as well as with Revive
Tokens to help fewer Heroes survive a little longer.  

| Heroes | Scaling |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | Low Threats, 2 Revive Tokens |
| 2      | Low Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 3      | Med Threats, 1 Revive Token |
| 4      | Med Threats |
| 5      | High Treats, 1 Revive Token |
| 6      | High Treats |
